## Title: US says Russians hacked critical infrastructure

The US Department of Justice has
charged four Russian government employees with cyber attacks on the global
energy sector between 2012-18.  

 They are accused of targeting hundreds of
companies and organisations in around 135 countries. 

 Their activities are said to
have caused two separate emergency shutdowns at one facility in Saudi Arabia.
The alleged conspirators subsequently attempted to hack the computers of a company that
managed similar critical infrastructure entities in the US. 

 Some of the
individuals are linked by the US indictment to the FSB, Russia’s Security
Service.

## Title: 'We buy drawing things for the kids'

Some 2.2 million people have now crossed into Poland from
Ukraine. With Ukrainian men of military age prevented from leaving, the vast majority of
them are women and children - and many are staying in Krakow, Poland's second
largest city and the first entry point for many refugees. 

 Margriet Helmhout owns a sock factory in the northern
Netherlands. She first donated some of her wares to the refugees before
deciding to drive down herself to help, volunteering at a kitchen in the square
outside Krakow's main station.  

 The trestle tables are lined with blue-and-yellow napkins,
matching the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Boxes behind the volunteers are
packed with plastic carrier bags, sanitary products and writing materials. 

 Margriet tells me she quickly realised that the refugees
needed more than clothes and food: "We were outside in the square in my
car, with a table in front. We only bought drawing things - books, pencils,
children's stuff," she said. "Then the women are more happy - the children
have something to do." 

 Margriet shows me a drawing the children made for her, a
sunset with Ukraine scrawled across the top. "It made me cry," she
said.

 A former UK toy store has reopened as an aid collection centre for those wishing to make donations for people in Ukraine.  

 Volunteers from a Polish social club, which started the project, said they've been "humbled" to have already received so many donations at the site in Southampton.  

 It is hoped much of the aid - which includes food, children's toys and clothes - will reach people trapped in the besiged southern port city of Mariupol.

## Title: Russia will emerge from war weaker, says top US defence strategist

Russia will regret its decision to attack Ukraine, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in a briefing on Thursday. 

 "I think with a high degree of certainty that Russia will emerge from Ukraine weaker than it went into the conflict," he said. 

 "Militarily weaker, economically weaker, politically and geopolitically weaker, and more isolated." 

 He added that the Russians are running out of precision missiles due to the month-long conflict. 

 Kahl also said that a forthcoming US strategy assessment will declare Russia "an acute threat", but added the country does not pose the same long term challenge to the US as China.

## Title: Ukraine claims to destroy 'large' Russian landing ship

On Thursday Ukrainian military officials said that they managed to destroy a large Russian landing ship called Saratov in the occupied port city of Berdyansk. 

 Another ship, the Orsk, was also destroyed and several other ships were damaged, military officials said. 

 An earlier briefing from Ukraine's military claimed that Russia remains focused on conquering southern Ukraine, in an effort to create a "land bridge" to the occupied territory of Crimea. 

 They are still trying to capture the cities fo Popasna, Rubizhne and Mariupol in the south, but have so far had "no success". 

 In Sumy and Kharkiv, the Russians are attacking civilian infrastructure, the report said, adding that some Russian forces are withdrawing after suffering losses as high as 50%. 

 The BBC cannot verify these claims for now.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russian forces have made steady progress in the beseigned southern city of Mariupol, entering the city's central area on 24 March.  

 The port city,  

 As the situation deteriorates in Mariupol, local Ukrainian authorities have left the city to better coordinate regional operations, says the ISW, which is an independent US-based think tank. 

 It said Russian forces have also continued shelling Kharkiv and struck a humanitarian aid delivery point, killing six and wounding 15, and secured several minor advances in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

## Title: Medvedev: Sanctions will not affect Moscow

Dmitry Medvedev, former Russia president and now deputy head of the country's security council, has said it would be "foolish" to believe that Western sanctions against Russian businesses could have any effect on the Moscow government. 

 The West has imposed an array of sanctions on Russia, with some sanctions specifically targeting billionaire businessmen believed to be close to President Vladimir Putin. 

 "Let us ask ourselves: can any of these major businessmen have even the tiniest quantum of influence of the position of the country's leadership?" Medvedev said in an interview with Russian state news agency RIA. 

 "I openly tell you: no, no way." 

 But analysts believe that putting the squeeze on oligarchs could work, as they could in turn pressure Putin to change his strategy. 

 Sociology professor Brooke Harrington, who has researched the offshore wealth of the super-rich, said "the wealthiest Russians are far better placed than the average citizen to communicate to Putin how his invasion is devastating his own country". 

 "The lavish lifestyles that oligarchs and their families lead mean they’re highly vulnerable to external pressure," she added in  [a recent column for The Atlantic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/russian-sanctions-oligarchs-offshore-wealth/623886/) 

 Stanislav Markus, who has studied Russia’s oligarchs,  [told US media outlet Vox](https://www.vox.com/recode/22971179/russian-oligarchs-influence-putin-ukraine-war-sanctions-limits)  that "more and more, they’re being pushed against the wall."

## Title: The latest developments on Ukraine

It's just past 7am in the UK, and if you're just joining us, welcome. Here's a recap: 

  .  US President Joe Biden is due to meet Ukrainian refugees on the Polish-Ukrainian border on Friday. More than two million Ukrainians have fled to Poland to escape the fighting   .  A month since Russia's invasion, Ukraine President Volodymr Zelensky has told European nations they had been "a little too late" to Moscow's threat, suggesting earlier sanctions may have prevented the war   .  He urged them to "not be late" in approving Ukraine's request to join the EU   .  Zelensky's speech followed an intense day of emergency summits in Brussels among Western nations united against Russia's invasion  

  .  Biden said Nato "would respond" if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine, but did not elaborate on how. The West has warned of such a scenario as the fight in Ukraine drags into its fifth week   .  Nato confirmed it would also be sending 40,000 troops in total to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania - the neighbours bordering Ukraine  

  .  UK PM Boris Johnson told the BBC that Ukraine can "certainly win" the war, but Putin doesn't appear interested in pursuing peace.   .  On the battlefields, a Russian landing ship was claimed to be destroyed in the occupied port city of Berdyansk on Thursday, said Ukrainian officials.  

 And with that, this is Tessa Wong and Frances Mao in Singapore, and Meryl Sebastian in Delhi, signing off. Our colleagues Alex Therrien and Rob Corp in London will continue to update you with the latest developments.

## Title: Ukraine fighting back and repelling Russian forces - UK

The UK's Ministry of Defence has released its latest intelligence assessment of the war, saying that Ukraine has been able to re-take towns and defensive positions east of the capital, Kyiv. 

 The MoD says Ukraine has also had some success pushing Russian forces back from land they had taken north-west of Kyiv.  

 The UK's analysis adds that Russia's supply lines are over-extended.

## Title: Ukraine emergency services detonate unexploded devices and put out fires

Ukraine authorities say in the past 24 hours they've contained multiple fires and explosions from Russian shelling. 

 On Thursday, the state emergency service extinguished 13 fires in Kyiv and six in Kharkiv caused by Russian strikes, the Internal Affairs ministry said. 

 Emergency workers in Kharkiv have also been clearing rubble from destroyed buildings and battling 25 grassfires and other blazes in open areas. 

 Local workers also managed to contain a blaze at an oil depot in Kalynivka, a small town just south of Kyiv.  

 In Luhansk, one of the breakaway eastern regions, Ukraine officials said Russian shelling had struck more than 30 buildings, including several tower blocks, houses and utilities.

## Title: Ukraine says 135 children killed since invasion began

UKraine's Prosecutor General's Office says 135 children have been killed and 184 wounded since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. 

 Giving an update on recent casualties, officials say two children were killed during fierce fighting in the city of Rubizhne, Luhansk region. 

 And on Thursday, two children aged six and 13 were injured in Novomykhailivka, Donetsk region, following Russian shelling. 

 Prosecutors added that three teenagers - aged 13, 14 and 15 - were blown up by a mine in Obilne in the Zaporizhia region.  

 They were taken to Melitopol Hospital where one is in a critical condition in intensive care. 

 The BBC has not been able to independently verify these reports.

## Title: Ukraine crisis tests unity as Biden visits Europe

After the disinterested, often EU-antagonistic Trump-years, the US is back with bells on when it comes to involvement in European security. 

 That's more or less been the message of President Joe Biden during his late week dash to G7, EU and Nato summits in Brussels on Thursday, with a fly-by to Poland on Friday. 

 The president's visit was borne out of the shadows of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And its aim was two-fold: 

  .  Symbolic: a determined show of Western unity in the face the Kremlin's attack on Ukraine, and on so-called liberal values, like democracy and human rights   .  Practical: in terms of security - both energy security and defence  

 Biden says he's offering the EU access to US natural gas and hydrogen supplies, as the bloc tries to wean itself off a heavy reliance on Russian energy. This will take time to organise. 

 The US president also made headlines during his European trip, announcing any chemical attack launched by Russia in Ukraine would be met "in kind" by Nato. Though he declined to go into detail. 

 Washington had so far shown huge reluctance to get too involved in Ukraine for fear of provoking a wider war with nuclear power Russia.

## Title: US set to sign gas deal with Europe

The European Union is expected to announce a deal which will see the US supply it with more liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies to replace Russian imports. 

 The US is set to provide at least 15 billion cubic metres of LNG by year's end, the Reuters news agency reported. 

 European nations are scrambling to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 

 The EU has pledged to cut its Russian gas use by two-thirds this year through imports from other countries and expanding renewable energy. 

 Speaking on Thursday night, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo welcomed the move saying it would help bring down gas prices in Europe.

## Title: Mariupol evacuation corridor planned for today

Some news now on the besieged city of Mariupol, where thousands of people remain trapped in basements with
little water, food, medicine or power. 

 Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk says Ukraine hopes to open a safe corridor to evacuate civilians in private vehicles today. 

 The city is suffering constant Russian
aerial assaults and artillery strikes, making departure - or even going above ground - a death-risk for residents. 

 Some civilians have managed to flee through humanitarian
corridors negotiated by Ukrainian and Russian officials, however.  

 More than 3,300 were said to have escaped on Thursday.

## Title: Russia digging in to harass Ukrainian people with artillery - analyst

More than a month into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, much of the commentary has been about whether the Kremlin's campaign has become bogged down. 

 James Crump, chief executive of intelligence consultancy Sibylline,
and a British army veteran, was asked for his analysis on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 

 He says Russia has been fighting on several different fronts – which has
been a failure of its campaign. 

 But he says the fighting in the south of the country has been led by its most
experienced commanders, and while the capital Kyiv has been a focus for its forces, Russia has largely achieved its aim of "liberating" Luhansk in the east and there’s heavy fighting in Donetsk. 

 "We’re seeing very little out of there," Crump says. "There's very intense fighting there between Ukraine's army and that’s where we’ll see
the most intense fighting in the coming weeks." 

 Crump says Russian forces are digging
in in the east of the country and using artillery to harass Ukraine cities and hold its people hostage.

## Title: Russian advance stalled on several fronts

Russia’s unprovoked invasion of its Slavic neighbour has triggered Europe’s worst security crisis since the Second World War. 

 And yet, one month on, Russian forces have failed to exert full control over a single major city, their advance has stalled on several fronts and in some places they have even lost ground to Ukrainian counter-attacks. 

 Bolstered by hi-tech weaponry from Britain and other Nato countries, Ukrainians have proven themselves both brave and resilient. But their defiance has come at a terrible cost. 

 The southern port of Mariupol will go down in history as one of the most bombed and shattered cities of our time. Its destruction has been labelled a war crime. 

 And Ukraine still faces major challenges. Its forces are running low on weapons and ammunition, armed Russian drones are now operating largely with impunity and Moscow is calling up reinforcements. 

 Russian President Vladimir Putin appears set on subjugating Ukraine, even if that means reducing it to a smouldering ruin.

## Title: EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance on Russia

The US and the EU have announced a major deal on liquified natural gas, in an attempt to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy. 

 The agreement will see the US provide the EU with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel - known as LNG - by the end of the year. 

 The bloc has already said it will cut Russian gas use in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  

 That will mean increasing imports and generating more renewable energy. 

 The deal was announced on Friday during a three-day visit by US President Joe Biden to Brussels.

## Title: Can the US solve Europe's gas demand?

A few moments ago it was confirmed that the US and EU have agreed a major deal on liquefied natural gas - a move intended to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy. 

 But even if the US significantly increases supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe, for the EU's 27 member states it is only a start. 

 The EU will still need to find other producers if they're to move away from Russian gas and hit their target of cutting imports by two-thirds this year. 

 Last year the EU imported 155 billion cubic metres of Russian gas. That's around 40% of its gas imports. Germany alone imports 55% of its gas from Russia, and it's already suspended the opening of a new Russian pipeline called Nord Stream 2. 

 Last year the EU said it received almost a quarter of its liquefied gas from the US, so if the US increases its supplies by an extra 15 billion cubic metres, that will make a big difference. 

 But it also raises big questions.  

 Qatar and Russia are the other big exporters and Qatar says it cannot divert much more to Europe. 

 On top of that, there is limited availability in liquefied natural gas terminals in Europe, which are already operating at high capacity.  

 There are 24 large-scale terminals in the EU - they're essential for "regasifying"  liquefied imports. Spain has most capacity but limited pipelines to the rest of Europe. 

 Germany is also looking beyond the US for LNG supplies and has been talking to Norway for shipments in time for next winter.

## Title: Mariupol theatre: 300 may have died - Ukraine officials

An update now on last week's theatre bombing in the southern city of Mariupol. 

 Until now, no death toll had been released as the debris and relentless shelling have made it hard to verify. 

 Now Ukrainian officials say some 300 people could have died in the strike, which hit a theatre where hundreds of people were sheltering.  

 Ukrainian officials say Russia carried out the strike. Russia denies attacking the theatre, although its attacks on countless residential buildings and other non-military facilities have been well documented across the country. 

 "From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft," Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram. 

 The BBC  [has spoken to survivors of the attack](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60835106) , who described for the first time what happened.

## Title: Biden's chemical weapons statement well judged - former UK security adviser

Former UK national security adviser Mark Sedwill said it is important that US President Joe Biden has sent a "more robust signal" that there could be interventions by Nato if chemical weapons are used by Russia in Ukraine. 

 Biden, who is in Europe to meet allies, said Nato "would respond" if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, though he did not spell out what that might mean. 

 Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sedwill says he thinks the  [framing of the statement from the US president ](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60854242) was "well judged". 

 He adds he'd like to see sanctions toughened to ultimately damage "capabilities of the Russian state". 

 Speaking about peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Sedwill says he's "deeply sceptical" that current discussions could achieve a stable outcome".

## Title: It will take years to rebuild Mariupol, city's mayor says

The humanitarian situation in the besieged city of Mariupol
continues to deteriorate, with Russia blocking the delivery of humanitarian
aid, the mayor has said. 

 The strategic port city has been surrounded by Russian
troops since the early days of the war, with no electricity, running water or
gas. Most of the city now lies in ruins. 

 “The situation is really
complicated. It’s a humanitarian crisis,” Vadym Boychenko told me. “Part of the city is occupied by Russian [forces] but our
soldiers are still controlling the city, but there is non-stop fighting.” 

 About 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol and efforts
to carry out large-scale evacuations have failed. Thousands have managed to
leave in recent days in private vehicles. Many have spoken of water, food and
medical supplies running out, and relentless Russian attacks. 

 “We’re working on the evacuation
[of residents] and I believe that's the only thing that can save people,” the
mayor said. “The city is destroyed. It’ll take years to rebuild it.” 

 He said 300 tonnes of humanitarian
aid had been waiting to be delivered but “Russian forces just don’t let it in”.  

 On Thursday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister accused Russia of blocking the
entry of humanitarian aid convoys for three days.

## Title: UK transport secretary to take in family of Ukrainian refugees

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he will be taking in a family of Ukrainian refugees into his home. 

 “I’m in touch, as I say, with my opposite number and also with the Ukrainian family who are coming to live with us in our home, and so I’m hearing about it direct on the ground," Shapps told Sky News. 

 “They are incredibly grateful to the British people for everything that we are doing.” 

 The UK government recently launched its Homes for Ukraine scheme, which  [lets people in the UK host Ukrainians refugees](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60555166)  who are known to them, but who do not have family ties here. 

 It also launched the  [family visa scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/apply-for-a-ukraine-family-scheme-visa)  for Ukrainians who have an immediate or extended family member in the UK. 

 The UK has been criticised for the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis in comparison with other European countries.

## Title: Could chemical weapons be used?

We've seen day in, day out, the extraordinary sense of resistance and patriotism among the Ukrainians.  

 But if it comes to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, it's a totally different game - a totally different battlefield. 

 The Ukrainian armed forces don't have that kind of protective gear. But interestingly - and hopefully not ominously - Nato is now talking about providing them with that kind of equipment. A Nato task force has also been activated to deal with potential scenarios.  

 Would they be used? 

 If this war drags on, if conventional weapons such as the long-range artillery that is terrorising the city of Mariupol doesn't work, and President Vladimir Putin wants to find a game-changer, he could look to chemical weapons.  

 He did it in Syria, when he was working with President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. And it worked. 

 Chlorine gas was also used in November 2016, the last month of a four-year siege of east Aleppo. It was dropped by helicopter. 

 In Ukraine, the Russians have already gone to the UN Security Council - just before  [a recent leak of ammonia at a chemical plant](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60818488)  caused by Russian shelling -  saying the Ukrainians have a US-backed biological and chemical weapons programme. They were met with a wall of derision and denial.  

 So there are signs that a chemical attack could happen, but no sign yet on the ground.

## Title: Four killed in Russian strike on medical centre in Kharkiv, say police

Four civilians have been killed and several others wounded after Russian strikes hit a medical centre in Kharkiv, local police say. 

 Kharkiv is Ukraine's second-largest city and stands near the Russian border in the east. 

 "This morning, following a bombardment on civilian infrastructure from several rocket launchers, seven civilians were injured, four of them died," police said.  

 The strikes had targeted a medical centre in the city's Osnovyansky district, they said. 

 The BBC has not independently verified this.  

 Russian forces have been trying unsuccessfully to encircle Kharkiv, with analysts saying they are short of ammunition. 

 The BBC's Quentin Sommerville says  [Ukrainian resistance in the city has frustrated the Russians](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60785679) , who have turned to artillery strikes, destroying entire neighbourhoods.

## Title: Poland sees slight increase in Ukraine refugees crossing border

More than 2.2 million people have fled Ukraine to Poland since the war began, the Polish Border Guard has said.  

 Numbers crossing the border have been falling in recent days, but Thursday saw a slight increase with 32,500 making the journey, up 7.4% from Wednesday, the agency wrote on Twitter.  

 By 06:00 GMT on Friday, 6,900 had crossed - that’s up 1.7% from the same period on Thursday.  

 Maciej Duszczyk, a professor of migration research at Warsaw University, estimates around 1.2-1.3 million refugees remain in Poland.

## Title: Kremlin: 'Nothing terrible will happen' if Russia pushed out of G20

The Kremlin has responded to comments by US President Joe Biden saying he favoured kicking Russia out of the G20 group of major economies in response to the invasion of Ukraine. 

 The Kremlin's take is that it wouldn't be disastrous. 

 "The G20 format is important, but in the current circumstances, when most of the participants are in a state of economic war with us, nothing terrible will happen," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. 

 Peskov said the world extended further than the US and Europe, and predicted that efforts to isolate Moscow would fail. 

 Ordinary Russians are seeing higher prices and shortages of some goods, after the US, EU, UK and allies imposed measures designed to damage Russia's economy.

## Title: Woman who fled Ukraine wins Jerusalem marathon

A Ukrainian refugee who fled to Israel with her 11-year-old daughter has just won the Jerusalem marathon. 

 Athlete Valentyna Veretska took the women's title in a time of 2hr 45min 54sec. 

 Veretska, 31, escaped Russia's invasion by crossing into Poland before travelling on to Israel. But according to the race organisers, her husband is still in Ukraine serving in the army. 

 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JudahAriGross/status/1507271835997683726)

 Veretska was one of about 40 Ukrainians who entered the race in Jerusalem's Old City, run in unseasonable rain and cold. 

 Israel has sent humanitarian support to Ukraine, but has so far refused to provide military aid or join sanctions against Russia.

## Title: Mariupol official confirms some 300 died in theatre bombing

We have another update on last week's [ bombing of a theatre in Mariupol](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60835106)  where civilians were sheltering. 

 An official has confirmed that an estimated 300 people died in the attack. 

 Petr Andryuschenko, advisor to deputy mayor of Mariupol, in an interview with Newshour on the BBC World Service, said nearly 600 people were inside the theatre before the attack.  Three hundred were in a shelter under the theatre.  

 The authorities had not been able to start the rescue operation because there was street fighting near the theatre, and the Russians were continuing to shell the area.  

 Andryuschenko is confident about the figures because they had a record of who was in the theatre before the missile strike, they've spoken to survivors, and they have checked how many survived.  

 He also confirmed that there is fighting in the middle of the city, but insisted that the Russians had not yet manage to take control.

## Title: UN warns of potential war crimes in Ukraine

Russia's use of
explosives with "wide area effects in or near populated areas – including
missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets as well as airstrikes" could
amount to war crimes, the UN's human rights monitoring mission for Ukraine has said. 

 The
head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bognor, cited two
specific examples: An attack on a school in Chernihiv, and the attack on the
maternity hospital in Mariupol. 

 The
UN also has reports of Russian forces shooting at and killing civilians who
were trying to evacuate by car, and of civilians being killed during peaceful
assemblies. 

 There
are also allegations of indiscriminate shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces
in Donetsk which the UN is looking into, and reports that people perceived to
be Russian sympathisers have been beaten or ill-treated by Ukrainian police.

## Title: Mariupol mass graves could each hold up to 200 bodies, UN says

Mass graves in the besieged southern city of Mariupol could each hold
up to 200 bodies, a human rights expert for the region has warned. 

 Matilda Bogner, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in
Ukraine, said her team was trying to assess the scale of the civilian casualties. 

 "One mass grave we've been able to get satellite information on, and we estimate that one of those mass graves holds about 200 people," she said. 

 But "that does not mean all those people are civilian casualties", she added - since the UN's numbers do no include military deaths or those who die for other reasons during a war. 

 At least 1,035 civilians have been killed, she said – though
the UN has consistently said it believes casualty numbers are "considerably
higher" than its official numbers, due to the difficulty in verifying
reports and getting information from war-hit areas. 

 Earlier this week, local
commanders said they thought Mariupol's death toll alone could be more than
3,000. Bodies are often left in the streets because it is too dangerous to
retrieve them, and many of them later end up in mass graves.

## Title: Russian TV protester avoids criminal charges

Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist who made international headlines for her live on-air anti-war protest on Russian state TV, has escaped criminal charges under Russia's strict new media laws. 

 Russia's Interfax news agency says that a court in Moscow has registered her case under the administrative offences code, rather than criminal charges - meaning she faces a fine of up to 50,000 roubles - about $500/£380 - for allegedly discrediting Russia's armed forces.  

 On 14 March, Ovsyannikova - a journalist at Russia's state-controlled Channel One - ran out behind the evening news presenter holding a placard that said: "No war, stop the war, don't believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here."  

 Some lawyers and activists had feared she would face prosecution under the new criminal offence that could send anyone spreading "fake news" about the military to prison for up to 15 years. 

 Speaking to the independent news outlet Meduza, Ovsyannikova said: "I am glad that this is not a criminal article. So I can continue to fight for the truth.”  

 She has already been fined 30,000 roubles and  [was detained for 14 hours](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60749279)  - but  [later told the BBC it was important](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-60781415)  for her to stop being a "cog in the Russian propaganda machine".

The UN rights office says it has confirmed
that at least 1,081 civilians have died and 1,707 have been injured in Ukraine since Russia invaded the country, adding that the true death

 Monitors are working to verify
reports of further deaths in places of intense fighting in various regions,
including Donestsk, where the city of Mariupol is located, the UN says. 

 The UN has previously said
casualty figures are likely higher than official numbers because

## Title: Polish president's plane turns back, makes emergency landing - state news agency

The plane carrying Poland's President Andrzej Duda to meet his US counterpart Joe Biden has had to turn back, and has made an emergency landing in Warsaw, Poland's state-run news agency PAP reports. 

 Duda did not face any danger, Reuters quoted his chief of staff as saying. 

 Polish reports say the president's plane had to return to Warsaw airport shortly after take-off because of a technical issue.  

 Duda was supposed to be at Rzeszow Airport in the south-east of Poland to meet Biden and brief him about the situation on the border with Ukraine.  

 Air Force One has landed, but it's unclear whether Duda will be able to fly to meet Biden now before he departs.

## Title: Russia to focus war on eastern Ukraine - Russian army chief

The chief of the Russian army says Russia will now focus its main war effort on the "complete liberation" of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region. 

 The defence ministry said Russia had been considering two options for its "special military operation" - one covering the whole of Ukraine and one focusing on the Donbas. 

 The comments - carried by Russian state news agencies - hinted at a possible downgrading of Russia's war aims. Russian forces have met strong resistance in the north of Ukraine and around Kyiv. 

 Sergey Rudskoy, head of the main operational department of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said 93% of Luhansk oblast and 54% of Donetsk oblast was under Russian control. 

 Russia had destroyed the vast majority of Ukraine's air force and navy, and this marked the successful end of the first phase of the conflict, he added. 

 However, the defence ministry did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said Russia would react immediately to any move to close airspace over Ukraine - something President Zelensky has repeatedly urged. 

 The ministry also said Russia would continue its invasion until targets set by Putin had been achieved, Ria news agency reported, without specifying what the targets were.

## Title: Putin cites JK Rowling as he accuses West of 'trying to cancel' Russia

Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of "trying to cancel" Russia, as he cited the backlash against British author JK Rowling. 

 "Today they are trying to cancel a thousand-year-old country. I am talking about the progressive discrimination against everything connected with Russia," Putin said in televised remarks, mentioning Russian music and literature. 

 Putin likened "cancel culture" to Nazis trying to burn books in the 1930s. 

 The Russian president also mentioned how British author JK Rowling had been "cancelled" because "she didn't satisfy the demands of gender rights".  

 Rowling has faced criticism for her views on transgender issues.  

 She has previously said she is concerned about a "new trans activism", saying it was "pushing to erode the legal definition of sex and replace it with gender". 

 The author has promised to match donations up to £1m to a charity she co-founded to help children in Ukraine.

## Title: Mariupol theatre bombing: They thought it would offer protection

The tragedy at the theatre in Mariupol will be remembered as an unacceptable, unjustified, and probably deliberate, attack on civilians. Another horror in a city that has seen so much of it in this war. 

 The site, a huge Soviet-era building in the middle of a square in the city centre, had been clearly marked as a civilian shelter, with the word “children” written in Russian on the ground outside. It is impossible it was attacked by mistake. 

 Hundreds of civilians, mainly women with children and elderly people, had gone there fleeing homes that were no longer safe, or no longer standing. They thought it was a place where they would find relative protection. 

 But there is no such place in Mariupol. Street after street, building after building, most of the city now lies in ruins. Nothing seems to remain untouched. Tens of thousands remain trapped inside the city, subjected to a medieval-like siege, with little food and water, no electricity or gas. 

 Russia has been accused of trying to starve the city into submission. For now Mariupol, despite all the suffering, says it will not surrender.

## Title: Poland's president arrives in reserve plane after emergency landing

As we reported earlier, the plane carrying Poland's President Andrzej Duda to meet Joe Biden in Rzeszow, eastern Poland, was turned back en route and had to make an emergency landing in Warsaw. 

 Duda has now arrived at Rzeszow airport in his reserve plane, after an earlier technical problem.  

 Biden’s motorcade had already left the airport so he can meet members of US military based nearby, the BBC's Dan Johnson reports. 

 But the leaders' schedules have been adjusted so they can still meet later.

## Title: Russia gives update on its military casualties

The Russian defence ministry has  [given an update on its military casualties](https://t.me/rian_ru/155675)  – for only the second time – claiming 1,351 of its soldiers have
been killed and 3,825 wounded, news agency Ria Novosti reports. 

 Ukrainian
military sources have previously estimated that as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed,
though this figure may include injured as well as dead. US intelligence
suggests half that number may have died. 

 The
first update from the Russian defence ministry on casualties was
on 2 March, and stated that 498 servicemen had died during the invasion. 

 Intriguingly,
on 21 March staunchly pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda (KP) published
an article quoting the defence ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen had
been killed in the conflict.  

 Later,
part of that article disappeared and KP's editor told the BBC the information
had been the result of a hack.

## Title: Why Rzeszow airport is a natural choice for Biden's visit to Poland

Driving around Rzeszow airport over the past few days, it’s clear how this city on Poland’s eastern border has become Nato’s military supply hub into Ukraine.  

 We saw an Antonov military transport aircraft land, its nose opened to release the hardware inside. Armoured vehicles and anti-ballistic missile batteries were parked on the runway, ready to travel across the border.  

 Some of the 9,000 American troops now stationed in Poland are there too. And it’s received many of the 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Poland.  

 So it’s a natural choice of destination for Joe Biden on his two-day trip to the country, visiting the humanitarian frontline and reassuring the eastern edge of a European Union whose illusion of post-war peace has been shattered. 

 It's also a city on edge. The local authorities are preparing to clear up the Cold War-era shelters in basements around Rzeszow, to ensure they would be ready for a Russian attack.  

 It's something they're desperate to avoid, of course – but they fear too that they could be in the line of fire of an unpredictable Vladimir Putin.

## Title: Hungary PM rejects Zelensky appeal for weapons and sanctions

Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky for weapons and tougher sanctions against Russia,
saying it would be "against Hungary's interests". 

 Orban rejected Zelensky's demands at the European Council
"because they are contrary to the interests of Hungary", Hungarian
government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs said in a statement. 

 "Hungary wants to stay out of this war, so it will not
allow the transfer of arms and weapons to Ukraine," Kovacs said. 

 Orban says that the ethnic-Hungarian minority in the west of
Ukraine would be threatened if Hungary sent weapons to Kyiv. 

 Hungary, an EU and Nato member, has refused to send military aid
to Kyiv, or let it cross its territory. However, it has allowed more than half
a million Ukrainian refugees to enter its territory. 

 Orban, a nationalist, has cultivated close ties with Russian
President Vladimir Putin in recent years. 

 Zelensky used an address to EU leaders on Thursday to call on
Orban to approve expanding sanctions, let weapons through to Ukraine, and cut
off business ties with Russia. 

 "Listen, Viktor, do you know what's going on in
Mariupol?" Zelensky said, referring to Ukraine's besieged south-eastern
port city. 

 "Once and for all, you should decide who you are
with," he said.

## Title: What did Biden mean by a 'response' to chemical weapons?

The possibility of Russia using chemical or biological weapons
is deeply troubling the US and its allies. 

 After the Nato summit in Brussels – where the topic was
discussed behind closed doors –  [President Biden said the use of chemical weapons by Russia would trigger
a response](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60870771)  "in kind". 

 He said "the nature of the response would depend on the
nature of the use". 

 So what might it look like? 

 Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to
reporters on Air Force One as the president flew to Poland. 

 He said: "We will select the form and nature of our
response based on the nature of the action Russia takes and will do so in
coordination with our allies." 

 But he also made clear: "The United States has no intention
of using chemical weapons under any circumstances." 

 The US and Nato are being deliberately ambiguous about how they
would respond if Vladimir Putin escalates his attack on Ukraine by using
chemical weapons. 

 They'll only say that Russia will pay a severe price if it uses
any kind of weapons of mass destruction - and that they have communicated that
directly to Kremlin. 

 The White House has already assembled a national security task
force – called the Tiger Team - to look at how it should react. And Nato is
issuing protective equipment to its forces stationed in Eastern Europe.

## Title: Moscow knows its pre-war strategy has failed

Russia says the "first stage" of what it calls its
"special military operation" has been mostly accomplished and that it
will now concentrate on "the liberation of the Donbas". 

 This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond
the "line of contact" that separates Ukrainian government-held
territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist
"people’s republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk. 

 Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow
knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. 

 "Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations
on multiple axes simultaneously," one official said. 

 As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated
and put into Russia’s operations, especially in the Donbas. 

 Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia
will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraine’s best fighting units, which are
stationed along the line of contact. 

 If more Russian firepower, particularly air power, is
concentrated in the east, those concerns will rise. 

 "I hope that's where the Western supply of arms will make a
significant contribution to Ukrainian forces," one official said.

## Title: JK Rowling responds to being referenced in Putin's speech

Earlier, we reported that Russian President  [Vladimir Putin cited British author
JK Rowling during a speech](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60856533?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=623dc3704f71af55b4615904%26Putin%20cites%20JK%20Rowling%20as%20he%20accuses%20West%20of%20%27trying%20to%20cancel%27%20Russia%262022-03-25T14%3A18%3A48.226Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:de29aa97-e0fc-4555-a41a-bcae194665b7&pinned_post_asset_id=623dc3704f71af55b4615904&pinned_post_type=share)  condemning "cancel culture"
in the West. 

 Putin accused the West of "trying to cancel" Russia,
as he cited the backlash against British author JK Rowling, who he said had
been "cancelled" because "she didn't satisfy the demands of
gender rights". 

 Rowling has faced criticism for her views on transgender issues. 

 Now, Rowling has responded by sharing an article about
incarcerated Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on social media, saying: "Critiques
of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently
slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison
their critics." 

 Her tweet was accompanied by the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine. 

 Rowling said she was personally matching all donations to a
charity she co-founded to help children in Ukraine, up to £1 million.

## Title: Burnt out Russian armour shows fierce Ukrainian resistance

Ukrainian forces are outnumbered and outgunned, but on the
outskirts of Kyiv we saw evidence of fierce and skilled resistance, and of the
damage they have inflicted on their more powerful enemy. 

 In one frontline area we counted four burnt out Russian armoured
personnel carriers and two destroyed T2 tanks. We cannot identify the location. 

 A commander from the 72nd mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian
army proudly showed us the wreckage, pointing out Russian ration packs
scattered in the grass alongside a sleeping bag. We were told the Russians made
four attempts to advance here this month but were defeated each time. 

 There was black smoke on the horizon and the sound of outgoing
shelling towards Russian positions every few minutes. 

 After a month of war Ukrainian forces are not just resisting but
in some areas they are reclaiming territory. For now, at the outskirts of Kyiv
the priority is holding the line and making sure the Russians cannot break
through. Retaining the capital is critical for Ukraine. Taking it is critical
for Moscow. 

 An elderly local man - who has remained living on the frontline -
wept at what President Putin has done to Ukraine's children. As he spoke he
kicked - in anger and in anguish - at charred human flesh on the ground. It was
the partial remains of a Russian soldier.

## Title: Russian colonel killed by own men - Western official

Two more senior Russian commanders have been killed - one of them apparently died after being attacked by his own men, a Western official has said.  

 The commanding officer of the 37th Motor Rifle Brigade, a colonel, was deliberately run over by his own troops as a result of the scale of losses taken by his brigade, the official said. 

 “That just gives an insight into perhaps some of the morale challenges that Russian forces are having,” they added. 

 However other reports suggested the colonel - named as Yuri Medvedev - had suffered leg injuries and had been evacuated to Belarus. 

 A seventh general (commander of the 49th Combined Arms Army) was also killed. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the claims.  

 The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently.

## Title: Spotify pulls out of Russia over new media laws

Spotify is pulling out of Russia due to the country's new laws
on what media companies can broadcast or post online. 

 Published material deemed to be "fake news" about
Russia's invasion of  [Ukraine could lead to lengthy prison sentences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60617365)  under the
new rules. 

 In a statement sent to media outlets, Spotify said the rules "further
restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalising
certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify’s employees and possibly even
our listeners at risk". 

 "After carefully considering our options and the current
circumstances, we have come to the difficult decision to fully suspend our
service in Russia." 

 Spotify is best-known as a music streaming platform, but has
aggressively moved into podcasting as part of its business model, with its
library including a great many news and current affairs shows. 

 The company closed its Russia office earlier in March, and has
not been able to sell its premium subscriptions in the country because of
restrictions put in place by payment providers amid international sanctions. 

 This makes Spotify the latest in a long list of major
international company to pull out of Russia - including McDonald's, Starbucks,
Apple, Samsung, and many more.

## Title: Ukrainian to be the only state language - Kyiv

Earlier we heard from a Russian negotiator that no progress had been made in Russia-Ukraine talks - now Ukraine's foreign minister has echoed this, underlining in a statement that there was as yet no consensus with Moscow on key issues. 

 Dmytro Kuleba also said that Ukrainian would remain the country's only state language. 

 Russia has demanded  [protection for the Russian language](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60785754)  in Ukraine. A significant minority of Ukrainians use Russian as their first language. 

 Kuleba said Ukraine did not intend to relinquish its demands.

 Earlier Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ukrainian and Russian negotiators had agreed on four out of the six main issues being discussed during
peace talks, but that territorial disputes on the eastern region
of Donbas and the Crimea peninsula remained.

## Title: In pictures: Biden shares pizza with US soldiers in Poland

US President Joe Biden has been meeting US soldiers in Rzeszow,
Poland. 

 He met members of the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division stationed
in the area of Rzeszow airport as part of Nato's protection of the alliance's
eastern flank. 

 He  [tweeted](https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1507391970443943946?s=20&t=kfsYzn7DGfG_hy4jdJ2tsg)  to say they're doing incredible work. 

 The president shared pizza and chatted with several military
personnel. 

 "Well, if you're starting to eat, I'm going to sit down and
have something to eat," Biden said. 

 Then he grabbed a piece of pepperoni and jalapeño pizza. The
jalapeños made his eyes water, so he dabbed at them with a napkin and someone
got him a glass of water. 

 Upon arriving in Poland, Biden met with a Polish delegation including Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak. 

 His schedule was delayed after the plane carrying Polish President Andrzej Duda was turned back en route to Rzeszow and made an emergency landing in Warsaw. Duda later boarded a
different aircraft and headed back to eastern Poland. An
official in his office said Duda had not been in any danger. 

 Biden and Duda are expected to meet later today. 

 Biden will also receive a briefing on Poland's response to the more than two million refugees who've flooded across the border from Ukraine in the past month.

## Title: First indication Moscow may be limiting war aims

The Donbas region in eastern Ukraine is the main focus now says
Moscow. 

 That includes Donetsk and Luhansk, held by Russian backed
separatists since 2014 and officially recognised as independent by Russia just
before this invasion began. 

 Over the past month, Russian forces made significant advances in
this region and along a southern corridor linking it with Crimea - the
peninsula annexed by Moscow, also in 2014. 

 Major General Sergei Rudskoi said Russia did not exclude attacks
on other cities, including the capital Kyiv, but this wasn’t its main
objective. 

 These comments are the first indication Moscow may be limiting
its war aims after a month where it’s failed to seize any major Ukrainian city
and its operations have been plagued by logistical difficulties and tactical
mistakes as well as fierce Ukrainian resistance. 

 But for now, its forces are still on the ground and in action
across large parts of Ukraine. And many Ukrainians are suffering bitterly, as
the human cost becomes ever clearer. 

 Details are only now emerging of the number of dead in last
week’s direct attack on a theatre in the besieged southern port city of
Mariupol. Urgent rescue efforts have been blocked by incessant Russian
shelling. 

 But there had been hope that some 1,000 people, mainly women and
children, sheltering in its underground bunker had been protected. Officials
now say at least 300 people were killed. 

 And the pitched battle for Mariupol, which now lies in ruin,
goes on.

## Title: Putin doesn't care about you - ex-Georgian leader to Lukashenko

A bit random, but Georgia's former leader Mikheil Saakashvili - a pro-Western reformer - has been addressing the longtime Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko on Twitter. 

 Belarus is effectively a client state of Russia. Russian troops invaded Ukraine from Belarus territory. However despite speculation Belarusian troops might be called to take part in the war, this has not yet happened. 

 Saakashvili told Lukashenko that his reign would be over if he sent his own troops into Ukraine. 

 "Luka, I've never given you bad advice. If you send troops to Ukraine, you will no longer be in power in a month at the most and you will end up very badly. Putin doesn't care about your fate, you know," the Georgian wrote. 

 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SaakashviliM/status/1507321790951051285)

 Saakashvili himself  [remains in prison in Georgia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59075044) . He made a surprise return to the country last year and was then arrested for a conviction he was given in absentia. He says he is a political prisoner.

## Title: Satellite photo shows destroyed Russian ship

New satellite photos from Maxar show the part-submerged Russian vessel that was destroyed in the occupied port of Berdyansk on Thursday. 

 The Ukrainian military said the Saratov, a landing ship,  [had been hit by its forces](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60859337) . The vessel had previously incorrectly been identified as the Orsk, the military said, adding that two other Russian landing ships had also sustained damage. 

 The satellite photos taken today shows black smoke continuing to billow from a structure on the port close to several fuel storage tanks.

## Title: Ukraine denies significant progress in peace talks

Ukrainian Foreign
Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said peace negotiations with
Russia are difficult, and denied reports that progress had been
made in resolving four out of six key issues. 

 It comes after a member of the Russian negotiating team earlier said that the two sides were coming closer to an understanding on secondary issues. Turkish President
Tayyip Erdogan was also reported as saying progress had been made in the talks. 

 But Kuleba said "there is no consensus with Russia on the four points". 

 "The negotiation process is very difficult," he posted on Facebook. "The Ukrainian
delegation has taken a strong position and does not relinquish
its demands. We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security
guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine."  

 Kuleba later tweeted that there was "no consensus in
negotiations yet", complaining "Russia sticks to ultimatums". 

 He added: "To stimulate a more constructive approach we need
two things: more sanctions and more military aid for Ukraine."

## Title: Journey to Kyiv's front line

Smoke as heavy as a winter fog hung over the last mile or so of the road into Irpin, just a 20-minute drive north-west of Kyiv. Trees and undergrowth in the pine forest on either side were burning, set alight by shelling. The road was almost empty. 

 When our BBC team was last able to come here, about three weeks ago, the city was badly damaged. Now it is in ruins. 

 Irpin sits in an arc of towns that also includes Bucha and Hostomel, where the most important fighting for the future of Kyiv is taking place. 

 Commander Oleg said the Russians had been pushed back. He explained that they were hitting Russian supply lines. Putin's men still had a toehold on the ground in Irpin, but the way they made their presence felt was with heavy artillery. 

 First-hand reporting helps, but it is still hard to penetrate the fog of war, especially in a place that is being shelled more or less constantly. As far as I could see, the claims made by the Ukrainian military that it is holding territory and even taking some of it back are true.

## Title: Interpol sends team to Moldova amid human trafficking concerns

Global police organisation Interpol has sent a team to Moldova amid human trafficking concerns as the country deals with a huge surge in refugees fleeing Ukraine. 

 Since the start of Russia's invasion, almost 380,000 Ukrainians have fled into neighbouring Moldova, which has a population of 2.6 million and is one of the poorest countries in Europe. 

 The Interpol team will be deployed in the capital Chisinau and different refugee camps, it said in a statement. 

 The agency has already received reports of human traffickers and smugglers waiting at border checkpoints to prey on "vulnerable" Ukrainians, it said.  

 "Children and unaccompanied minors are especially vulnerable to exploitation by smugglers and traffickers," Interpol warned.

## Title: Kherson 'contested territory again' - US defence official

Kherson, the southern Ukrainian city that was the first major population centre captured at the start of the war, is "contested territory again," a US defence official has told journalists.  

 If the city, which is relatively close to the Crimean peninsula, were to be retaken by Ukraine, it would represent a major setback for Russia's offensive.  

 Russia's military has disputed that it has lost control of Kherson, and Ukrainians on the ground there have not reported that it has been recaptured.  

 "The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back, and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again," the Pentagon official told reporters on Friday. 

 "We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before," added the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity. 

 Fighting is ongoing in the larger region of Kherson Oblast, according to the latest reports, as Russia continues to focus its efforts on taking the southern Black Sea coast.

## Title: How could Nato respond to a chemical attack in Ukraine?

Nato leaders have been growing increasingly concerned that Russia, faced with
something of a military stalemate in much of its campaign in Ukraine,
could be preparing to launch a chemical attack in order to break the deadlock.
There is no published evidence on the ground to back this up but
President Biden has warned that Nato would respond to a chemical attack "in
kind". 

 So
what does that mean exactly? Well it does not mean a Nato chemical attack in
response. Jake Sullivan, the US National Security Adviser, made that clear on
Friday when he said the US would not use chemical weapons under any
circumstance. Both the US and Russia are signatories to the 1997 Chemical
Weapons Convention, an international treaty outlawing these horrific weapons,
also signed by 191 other nations.  

 Russia
is supposed to have destroyed all its chemical weapons stocks by 2017. But the
following year it was blamed for the poisoning in Salisbury of former KGB
officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter using the nerve agent Novichok smeared
onto their front door. This is why President Biden has said Russia has used
chemical weapons before. 

 Even if Russia has secretly held back some stocks of poison gas or liquid nerve
agent, which it has not admitted to, it is unlikely to be in a position to use
this on a mass scale on the battlefield in Ukraine.  

 Instead, experts believe,
the most likely risk is that Russian forces could attempt a deliberate release
of toxic industrial chemicals like chlorine from existing Ukrainian
factories. This could have a devastating effect on civilians living in a
built-up area and in the fog and confusion of war it may not be immediately
clear who was responsible. A recent release of ammonia gas was deemed to be
accidental.  

 If such a blurred line existed it might be hard for Nato countries
to reach a unanimous decision on how harshly they should respond.

## Title: France working with Turkey and Greece on plan for Mariupol evacuations

French President
Emmanuel Macron has said he's working with Turkey and Greece on plans for a "humanitarian
operation" to evacuate people from the devastated southern city of Mariupol. 

 He
said he hoped to speak to Russia's President Putin in the next few hours regarding
the planned initiative. 

 The
port city of Mariupol lies in ruins
after relentless Russian shelling. Tens of thousands remain trapped inside, with little access to food, water, electricity or gas. 

 Macron told reporters there was a "concrete" discussion today with the mayor of Mariupol. "We are coordinating and we will then negotiate with the Russians," he said. 

 Earlier, an official told the BBC that an estimated  [300 people had died in last week's attack on a theatre in the city](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60873435) , where civilians
had been sheltering.

## Title: Apology after email addresses revealed

The Foreign Office has apologised after mistakenly sharing the email addresses of dozens of
people who were living in Ukraine and seeking refuge in the UK. 

 It failed to
hide recipients' emails when it sent out a mass email asking those seeking help
whether they had managed to leave Ukraine. 

 The email was
sent to 42 recipients on 20 March. 

 BBC Radio 4's PM programme was alerted
to the breach by Sam who left Kyiv with his partner having first sought Foreign
Office advice.  

 He said it was a "huge security
risk" that could see them targeted by Russia. 

 "I would
say we have had a weak form of generic apology, with ... no action, no real
formal apology, no real public apology. Nothing that is putting my mind at
rest," he said. 

 The Foreign Office suggestion to "maybe try looking out for any spam emails" was "weak and woefully inadequate", he said. 

 Last year the Ministry of Defence twice mistakenly shared the email addresses of Afghans who wanted to relocate to the UK as the Taliban were taking over the country.

## Title: It doesn't matter what's written on the sign - Russian asterisk protester

Dmitry Reznikov is a 22-year-old student in Moscow. He was
detained on 13 March for holding up a sign with no words, only asterisks. He
was fined 50,000 roubles (about £380) for discrediting Russia's armed forces. 

 "I made the decision to do it on an impulse," Reznikov
says. "I knew it doesn’t matter what is written on the sign, it could have
been blank, we've seen people arrested for that before. Everyone understands
what this sign is about and what side it expresses." 

 He adds, "It's important that people shouldn't stay silent
if they agree that what is going on is terrible, they should express their
opinion." 

 Reznikov tells me: "The main reason I did it is because
there is no justification for this conflict. Civilians and soldiers are dying.
I wasn’t trying to discredit the army." 

 The 22-year-old has been detained twice since the start of the
conflict. He used to protest before what is being described here as President Putin's special military
operation, but says, "Now I am far more afraid to do it. There’s more
repression and criminal prosecutions." 

 Reznikov says he doesn't know what will happen next in Russia.
"I hope the conflict will stop, that no more people will die."

## Title: Macron dismisses Putin demand for gas payments in roubles

French President Emmanuel
Macron has said there is no reason to accept a demand
from Russia to pay up in roubles for Russian gas.  

 Europe is attempting to reduce its reliance on Russian gas due to the invasion of Ukraine. 

 Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he wanted "unfriendly" countries to buy its gas with roubles. The move is understood to be aimed at boosting the Russian currency, which has lost over 20% in value this year. 

 "All the texts that have been signed are clear. This is
forbidden," Macron told a news conference after a European Union
summit in Brussels.  

 "European firms that buy gas and which are operating on
European territory have to do so in euros. Therefore it is not
possible today to do what is being demanded, it is not
contractual," added Macron.

Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is in good spirits and working hard to counter Kremlin war propaganda, his chief-of-staff tells the BBC. 

 Leonid Volkov says he received a note from Navalny today and his lawyers visit him nearly every day. 

 "He isn’t desperate, his moral condition is very good and he is very actively involved in the work the Anti-Corruption Foundation is doing to reach more Russians with counter-propaganda," Volkov said. 

 Navalny - whose sentence was recently extended by nine years - was working to "increase the cost of this war to Vladimir Putin", Volkov added. 

 The opposition leader has called on Russians to demonstrate against the war. Thousands of demonstrators have been detained in Russia.

## Title: Kyiv cafes reopen to ‘make people smile’ in wartime

Young people are leisurely chatting by a hipster coffee
shop in central Kyiv.  

 It's one of many places with excellent coffee, something
the city has become known for in recent years. A group of friends are playing
table tennis nearby in the afternoon sun. 

 "We have reopened and are going to keep working as
long as we can," barista Mykola tells us. "We are doing this to make
people smile." 

 The Kashtan café where he is working is one of the places
serving customers still staying in the city. 

 "Death to the Russian invaders. Coffee for defenders
is free," a sign at another coffee place says. Not charging the military
or territorial defence fighters is a common practice. 

 Many Kyiv trendy restaurants and cafes have turned into
field kitchens, cooking thousands of free meals for the city defenders or
people in need. 

 Some serve customers too, in attempt to bring a sense of
normality to the residents, operating limited hours to respect the daily
curfew. The Kyiv authorities have put together a map of cafes and other
businesses now open. 

 As we leave, with our flat whites in hand, dull thuds of
explosions are heard in the distance. A grim reminder that Kyiv is still very
much a city in wartime.

## Title: Latest US intelligence assessment

A senior US defence official has just given a briefing from Warsaw, where President Joe Biden has been speaking to American troops stationed in Poland. 

 As we reported earlier, the official - who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity - argued that Ukrainian forces could retake Kherson, the southern city captured by Russia in the first days of the war. 

 Here are some other key points: 

  .  Russia has conducted 1,250 missile launches in first 30 days of war   .  Russia has increased its aerial sorties in recent weeks, now flying an average of 300 per day   .  US officials confirm Ukraine's claim that it destroyed a ship transporting Russian tanks in the occupied port city of Berdyansk   .  Troops around Kyiv are digging in, and do not appear to be preparing for a ground assault on the capital   .  Makariv, a suburb west of Kyiv, is also now heavily contested by both sides   .  Russian troops are making no progress in their attacks on Kharkiv, in the north   .  Russian troops are stationed around 15km outside of Mykolaiv, a city near Kherson, and are trying to close the city off to resupply from Ukraine   .  Putin's troops managed to break through a Ukrainian defence near Izyum, and have moved south towards the Donbas territory

## Title: Zelensky: 'The sea will not be calm for them'

In his nightly Facebook address, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky argues that the country has struck "powerful blows" to invading forces.  

 "Over the past week, our heroic Armed Forces have dealt powerful blows to the enemy. Significant losses," he says. 

 "They say that the Minister of Defence of Russia has disappeared somewhere," he adds, referring to the reported disappearance of Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu, who has not been seen in public since 11 March. 

 Shoigu did, however, appear for a few seconds on Thursday after a nearly two-week absence in a televised meeting Putin was holding with government ministers. 

 "I am grateful to our defenders who showed the occupiers that the sea will not be calm for them even when there is no storm. Because there will be fire," Zelensky added ominously. 

 "By restraining Russia's actions, our defenders are leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: talk is necessary. Meaningful. Urgent. Fair. For the sake of the result, not for the sake of the delay." 

 Zelensky added that the suffering in Mariupol is worsening, as tens of thousands of people are trapped without food, water or heat. 

 "The situation in the city remains tragic. Absolutely tragic. The Russian military does not allow any humanitarian aid into the city," said Zelensky.
