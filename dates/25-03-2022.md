## Title: US says Russians hacked critical infrastructure

The US Department of Justice has
charged four Russian government employees with cyber attacks on the global
energy sector between 2012-18.  

 They are accused of targeting hundreds of
companies and organisations in around 135 countries. 

 Their activities are said to
have caused two separate emergency shutdowns at one facility in Saudi Arabia.
The alleged conspirators subsequently attempted to hack the computers of a company that
managed similar critical infrastructure entities in the US. 

 Some of the
individuals are linked by the US indictment to the FSB, Russia’s Security
Service.

## Title: 'We buy drawing things for the kids'

Some 2.2 million people have now crossed into Poland from
Ukraine. With Ukrainian men of military age prevented from leaving, the vast majority of
them are women and children - and many are staying in Krakow, Poland's second
largest city and the first entry point for many refugees. 

 Margriet Helmhout owns a sock factory in the northern
Netherlands. She first donated some of her wares to the refugees before
deciding to drive down herself to help, volunteering at a kitchen in the square
outside Krakow's main station.  

 The trestle tables are lined with blue-and-yellow napkins,
matching the colours of the Ukrainian flag. Boxes behind the volunteers are
packed with plastic carrier bags, sanitary products and writing materials. 

 Margriet tells me she quickly realised that the refugees
needed more than clothes and food: "We were outside in the square in my
car, with a table in front. We only bought drawing things - books, pencils,
children's stuff," she said. "Then the women are more happy - the children
have something to do." 

 Margriet shows me a drawing the children made for her, a
sunset with Ukraine scrawled across the top. "It made me cry," she
said.

## Title: Former UK toy store reopens as Ukraine donation centre

*There is a video, but the bot cannot display it. Please click on the link above to view it.*

 A former UK toy store has reopened as an aid collection centre for those wishing to make donations for people in Ukraine.  

 Volunteers from a Polish social club, which started the project, said they've been "humbled" to have already received so many donations at the site in Southampton.  

 It is hoped much of the aid - which includes food, children's toys and clothes - will reach people trapped in the besiged southern port city of Mariupol.

## Title: Russia will emerge from war weaker, says top US defence strategist

Russia will regret its decision to attack Ukraine, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl told reporters in a briefing on Thursday. 

 "I think with a high degree of certainty that Russia will emerge from Ukraine weaker than it went into the conflict," he said. 

 "Militarily weaker, economically weaker, politically and geopolitically weaker, and more isolated." 

 He added that the Russians are running out of precision missiles due to the month-long conflict. 

 Kahl also said that a forthcoming US strategy assessment will declare Russia "an acute threat", but added the country does not pose the same long term challenge to the US as China.

## Title: Biden to visit Polish-Ukraine border

US President Joe Biden will on Friday travel to a town near the Polish-Ukrainian border on the final leg of his four-day Europe trip. 

 Air Force One will land in the Polish town of Rzeszow, a few kilometres from  the Ukraine border. 

 During his visit, Mr Biden is expected to meet members of the US 82nd Airborne Division, part of NATO's increasingly muscular deployment to its eastern flank. 

 He will also receive a briefing on the dire humanitarian situation in Ukraine. More than two million refugees have fled to Poland - the capital Warsaw hosts around 300,000 of them. 

 Mr Biden will meet Polish President Andrzej Duda to thank the country for their humanitarian efforts.  

 The US President's trip comes as the West faces urgent questions about what more it will do to help Ukrainians still in the country withstanding Russian onslaught.

## Title: What did Biden mean by a 'response' to chemical weapons?

The possibility of Russia using chemical or biological weapons
is deeply troubling the US and its allies. 

 After the Nato summit in Brussels – where the topic was
discussed behind closed doors –  [President Biden said the use of chemical weapons by Russia would trigger
a response](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60870771)  "in kind". 

 He said "the nature of the response would depend on the
nature of the use". 

 So what might it look like? 

 Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to
reporters on Air Force One as the president flew to Poland. 

 He said: "We will select the form and nature of our
response based on the nature of the action Russia takes and will do so in
coordination with our allies." 

 But he also made clear: "The United States has no intention
of using chemical weapons under any circumstances." 

 The US and Nato are being deliberately ambiguous about how they
would respond if Vladimir Putin escalates his attack on Ukraine by using
chemical weapons. 

 They'll only say that Russia will pay a severe price if it uses
any kind of weapons of mass destruction - and that they have communicated that
directly to Kremlin. 

 The White House has already assembled a national security task
force – called the Tiger Team - to look at how it should react. And Nato is
issuing protective equipment to its forces stationed in Eastern Europe.

## Title: Moscow knows its pre-war strategy has failed

Russia says the "first stage" of what it calls its
"special military operation" has been mostly accomplished and that it
will now concentrate on "the liberation of the Donbas". 

 This is likely to mean a more concerted effort to push beyond
the "line of contact" that separates Ukrainian government-held
territory in the east of the country from the Russian backed separatist
"people’s republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk. 

 Western officials believe the announcement implies that Moscow
knows that its pre-war strategy has failed. 

 "Russia is recognising that it can't pursue its operations
on multiple axes simultaneously," one official said. 

 As many as 10 new battalion tactical groups are being generated
and put into Russia’s operations, especially in the Donbas. 

 Western officials have been concerned for some time that Russia
will attempt to encircle and envelop Ukraine’s best fighting units, which are
stationed along the line of contact. 

 If more Russian firepower, particularly air power, is
concentrated in the east, those concerns will rise. 

 "I hope that's where the Western supply of arms will make a
significant contribution to Ukrainian forces," one official said.

## Title: JK Rowling responds to being referenced in Putin's speech

Earlier, we reported that Russian President  [Vladimir Putin cited British author
JK Rowling during a speech](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60856533?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=623dc3704f71af55b4615904%26Putin%20cites%20JK%20Rowling%20as%20he%20accuses%20West%20of%20%27trying%20to%20cancel%27%20Russia%262022-03-25T14%3A18%3A48.226Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:de29aa97-e0fc-4555-a41a-bcae194665b7&pinned_post_asset_id=623dc3704f71af55b4615904&pinned_post_type=share)  condemning "cancel culture"
in the West. 

 Putin accused the West of "trying to cancel" Russia,
as he cited the backlash against British author JK Rowling, who he said had
been "cancelled" because "she didn't satisfy the demands of
gender rights". 

 Rowling has faced criticism for her views on transgender issues. 

 Now, Rowling has responded by sharing an article about
incarcerated Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on social media, saying: "Critiques
of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently
slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison
their critics." 

 Her tweet was accompanied by the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine. 

 Rowling said she was personally matching all donations to a
charity she co-founded to help children in Ukraine, up to £1 million.

## Title: No progress on key issues - Russian negotiator

Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are continuing - but
there has been little progress on the main political issues, according to a
member of the Russian negotiating team. 

 Vladimir Medinsky said the two sides were "treading
water". 

 However, he said they were coming closer to an understanding on
secondary issues. 

 "Negotiations have been going on all week, from Monday to
Friday, in video conference format, and will continue tomorrow," he said.

## Title: Spotify pulls out of Russia over new media laws

Spotify is pulling out of Russia due to the country's new laws
on what media companies can broadcast or post online. 

 Published material deemed to be "fake news" about
Russia's invasion of  [Ukraine could lead to lengthy prison sentences](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60617365)  under the
new rules. 

 In a statement sent to media outlets, Spotify said the rules "further
restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalising
certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify’s employees and possibly even
our listeners at risk". 

 "After carefully considering our options and the current
circumstances, we have come to the difficult decision to fully suspend our
service in Russia." 

 Spotify is best-known as a music streaming platform, but has
aggressively moved into podcasting as part of its business model, with its
library including a great many news and current affairs shows. 

 The company closed its Russia office earlier in March, and has
not been able to sell its premium subscriptions in the country because of
restrictions put in place by payment providers amid international sanctions. 

 This makes Spotify the latest in a long list of major
international company to pull out of Russia - including McDonald's, Starbucks,
Apple, Samsung, and many more.
