Title: Johnson again rules out Ukraine no-fly zone

Johnson says there is an "agony everyone feels in this group [Nato]" over its inability to do more to help "given the constraints we face". 

 The UK PM again rules out a no-fly zone over Ukraine - saying it would involve the RAF taking down Russian fast jets. No country in Nato is going to do that, he adds. 

 But Johnson says Nato is looking at providing missiles for Ukraine to defend itself from the air - and also from Grad rocket launchers - which he says have been merciless in their onslaught.

Title: I'm not remotely anti-Russian - UK PM

Asked about a quote from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said earlier that Boris Johnson was the "most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, the UK PM insisted that he was "not remotely anti-Russian". 

 He said he was sympathetic to the Russian people - but not to their leader Vladimir Putin. 

 "We all agree that what Putin is doing is utterly catastrophic, his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric and the conduct of that invasion is moving into the type of behaviour that we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years," he says.

Title: Talk of nuclear confrontation a distraction, says Johnson

Responding to a question from Bloomberg, Johnson says talk about the use of nuclear weapons is a distraction from what is going on in Ukraine. 

 He says the use of conventional weapons by Russia - including artillery - is "absolutely barbaric". 

 Moscow is trying to frame this as a confrontation between nuclear powers, he says - but it is between Russia and the people of Ukraine.

Title: undefined

Johnson is asked about Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg saying earlier that there would be severe consequences if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine and does that mean boots on the ground? 

 The PM says those weapons are viewed with “utter horror” by Nato leaders.  

 He says if Putin were to engage in anything like that “the consequences would be very, very severe”. 

 You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, he adds - but it would be “catastrophic for him” and “I think he understands that”.

Title: Putin was banking on Nato being split - Biden

Biden says the US is determined to sustain its efforts with its allies on Ukraine. 

 He said the US was announcing new sanctions on 400 Russian individuals and entities, including 300 members of the Duma - Russia's parliament - as well as oligarchs and companies that "fuel the Russian war machine". 

 And he says Putin badly miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine. 

 "Putin was banking on Nato being split. From my conversations with him it was clear he didn't think it could sustain this cohesion," he says 

 "Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he thought he was going to get when he went into Ukraine. 

 "Nato has never never
been more united than it is today."

Title: Chemical weapons use would trigger response in kind - Biden

Biden has been asked twice about the potential use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine and what the Nato and US response would be. 

 In his first reply he says the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use of chemical weapons. 

 Pressed on whether it would trigger direct Nato intervention in Ukraine, he says it would "trigger a response in kind". 

 "On Nato, we'd make that decision at the time," he says.

Title: We must stay united - Biden

Biden ends his news conference with a call for Western countries to maintain a united front towards Russia. 

 Asked whether sanctions would deter Putin, he says the most important thing is that they be sustained. 

 "The maintenance of sanctions - increasing the pain - to be sure that after a month we will sustain what we are doing. That's what will stop him," he says. 

 "The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and for the world to focus on what a brute he is. 

 "if you're Putin and you think Europe is going to crack in a month - they can take anything for a month - we have to stay totally, thoroughly united."

Title: Nato wants war to continue - Russia foreign ministry

Russia's foreign ministry has been reacting to today's Nato summit. 

 It says the decision to continue support to Kyiv shows that the Western alliance wants the conflict to continue, in a statement reported by Russia's Ria news agency. 

 The West was "reaping a terrible harvest" from its decision to arm Ukraine, which had encouraged the Ukrainian government to use force against Russian-backed separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine, the ministry said. 

 Russia has previously said that people in the separatist enclaves were facing "genocide".

## Title: Russia blocking aid to Mariupol but handing out its own

About 2,700 people were able to leave the besieged and destroyed city of Mariupol today, Ukraine's deputy prime minister says. 

 But Iryna Vereshchuk accused Russia of blocking humanitarian aid convoys into the city for the past three days. The World Health Organization also says it has been unable to reach Mariupol. 

 Russia has taken control of parts of the city. In one such area it handed out supplies to hundreds of residents who emerged from their places of shelter, according to a Reuters news report from the city. 

 At the scene was Denis Pushilin, the leader of the Russian-backed separatist enclave of Donetsk, as well as an official from Putin's United Russia party, Andrei Turchak, according to pro-Russian separatist media. 

 Turchak wrote on his Telegram channel that Russia would rebuild Mariupol but added - "Make no mistake, Russia is here forever".

## Title: Ukraine striking high value Russian targets - Ministry of Defence

Ukrainian forces are striking "high value targets" in Russian-occupied areas of the country, Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) says in one of its regular intelligence updates. 

 These targets include a landing ship and ammunition depots  [in the occupied port of Berdyansk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60859337) , the MoD says.  

 The MoD predicts the Ukrainians will continue to target Russian logistics, depriving them of fresh supplies, reducing their ability to mount attacks and "further damage already dwindling morale".

## Title: Chernobyl workers can't get to work due to shelling - IAEA

The UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), says Ukraine has told it that Russian forces are shelling checkpoints in the city of Slavutych. 

 The city of around 25,000 residents is where many workers from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant live. 

 Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986, has been under the control of Russian forces for about a month. 

 Ukraine has told the IAEA that the shelling is endangering the homes and families of staff at Chernobyl and preventing the further rotation of personnel to and from the site.  

 Rafael Grossi, head of the IAEA, said he was concerned by the development which comes just a few days after staff were allowed to return home after nearly four weeks without a change of shift.  

 He said the IAEA would continue to closely monitor the situation.

## Title: What Ukraine is getting right

One month into this invasion and so far, Ukraine has defied the odds. Outnumbered on almost every metric - in tanks, in troops, in aircraft - Ukraine's forces, reinforced by citizen volunteers, have in many places fought the Russian army to a standstill. 

 The tide could still turn against Ukraine. Its forces are running dangerously low on the vital Western-supplied anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles needed to fend off the advancing Russians. 

 Yet despite this, Ukraine's forces are outperforming Russia's in this war, on several levels. This week the Pentagon spokesman John Kirby praised them as defending parts of their country "very smartly, very nimbly, very creatively".  

 So what exactly have been the secrets of their success?
