## Title: Johnson again rules out Ukraine no-fly zone

Johnson says there is an "agony everyone feels in this group [Nato]" over its inability to do more to help "given the constraints we face". 

 The UK PM again rules out a no-fly zone over Ukraine - saying it would involve the RAF taking down Russian fast jets. No country in Nato is going to do that, he adds. 

 But Johnson says Nato is looking at providing missiles for Ukraine to defend itself from the air - and also from Grad rocket launchers - which he says have been merciless in their onslaught.

## Title: I'm not remotely anti-Russian - UK PM

Asked about a quote from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said earlier that Boris Johnson was the "most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, the UK PM insisted that he was "not remotely anti-Russian". 

 He said he was sympathetic to the Russian people - but not to their leader Vladimir Putin. 

 "We all agree that what Putin is doing is utterly catastrophic, his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric and the conduct of that invasion is moving into the type of behaviour that we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years," he says.

## Title: Talk of nuclear confrontation a distraction, says Johnson

Responding to a question from Bloomberg, Johnson says talk about the use of nuclear weapons is a distraction from what is going on in Ukraine. 

 He says the use of conventional weapons by Russia - including artillery - is "absolutely barbaric". 

 Moscow is trying to frame this as a confrontation between nuclear powers, he says - but it is between Russia and the people of Ukraine.

## Title: undefined

Johnson is asked about Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg saying earlier that there would be severe consequences if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine and does that mean boots on the ground? 

 The PM says those weapons are viewed with “utter horror” by Nato leaders.  

 He says if Putin were to engage in anything like that “the consequences would be very, very severe”. 

 You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, he adds - but it would be “catastrophic for him” and “I think he understands that”.

## Title: Putin was banking on Nato being split - Biden

Biden says the US is determined to sustain its efforts with its allies on Ukraine. 

 He said the US was announcing new sanctions on 400 Russian individuals and entities, including 300 members of the Duma - Russia's parliament - as well as oligarchs and companies that "fuel the Russian war machine". 

 And he says Putin badly miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine. 

 "Putin was banking on Nato being split. From my conversations with him it was clear he didn't think it could sustain this cohesion," he says 

 "Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he thought he was going to get when he went into Ukraine. 

 "Nato has never never
been more united than it is today."

## Title: WHO says it can't get medical supplies into Mariupol

The World Health Organization says it is still unable to get
desperately needed medical supplies into the besieged southern town of Mariupol,
and also Mykolaiv, which is further west on the Black Sea. 

 Tarik Jasarevic, of the WHO, has just arrived in the central-eastern city of Dnipro, and
told the BBC the UN health agency is setting up a staging post to move
supplies, but has not been able to reach the two areas. 

 The WHO says it has verified 64 attacks on healthcare up to 21
March. Jasarevic said this hospitals, medical centres and ambulances had been
hit. 

 He said such attacks have "a devastating effect on everyone". 

 Health workers don’t feel safe doing their jobs, patients are
afraid to seek treatment, and immunisation programmes, care for chronic disease
such as diabetes and cancer, and maternity care were all affected, he said. 

 If healthcare is not protected "the community will just
basically be terrified, knowing that there are no more humanitarian boundaries
to the war and there is no safe place," he said.

## Title: 'We believe in what we're fighting for'

With reports that Russia's offensive has largely stalled, Ukraine says its forces are now shifting onto the offensive across parts of the country. 

 Taras Ishchyk, a member of the territorial defence forces of the
Ukrainian army, is in the city of Lviv. He tells the BBC the armed forces can defeat the Russians
because Ukrainians believe in what they are fighting for. 

 "All of our soldiers are full of fury now because Russians
don't have any moral rules," he says. "They kill... civilians, children, old people." 

 He describes the actions of Russia in this invasion as "disgusting".  

 "We are very motivated to finish this war
and to win this war," the former marketing manager says. "We all know for what we fight, and they don't know, so
it's a big difference."

 If you're just joining us, there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity as Nato, G7 and EU leaders met in Brussels: 

  .  Biden said Nato has never been more united and this was the opposite of what Putin thought would happen. He urged continuing unity so sanctions would stay in place long enough to affect Moscow's decision-making   .  Biden, the UK's Johnson and France's Macron all refused to say exactly how they would respond if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. But Biden said the nature of the US response would depend on the nature of the chemical weapons used   .  Nato has confirmed that four new battlegroups comprised of 40,000 troops in total will be sent to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania   .  Germany's Scholz and EU chief von der Leyen say payments for Russian energy won't be made in roubles as Moscow has demanded - "the time of Russian energy blackmail is over," von der Leyen said  

 In Ukraine itself fighting has continued: 

  .  A Russian landing ship has been destroyed and two other vessels damaged in the occupied Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk, say Ukrainian officials. It is unclear what caused the explosion   .  Ukraine says it has conducted the first proper prisoner exchange with Russia since the war began, with 10 Ukrainians exchanged for 10 Russians. In a separate exchange 11 Russian civilian sailors rescued from a ship that sank off Odesa were swapped for 19 Ukrainian seafarers from a ship captured by the Russians   .  The World Health Organization says it is still unable to get desperately needed medical supplies into the besieged south-eastern town of Mariupol, and also Mykolaiv, which is further west.

## Title: Ukraine can certainly win, says Boris Johnson

*There is a video, but the bot cannot display it. Please click on the link above to view it.*

 "I think Ukraine can certainly win," UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the BBC. 

 Speaking to Newsnight's Nick Watt, he said: "I don't think it's going to be easy. There's a sense in which Putin has already failed, or lost, because I think that he had literally no idea that the Ukrainians were going to mount the resistance that they are, and he totally misunderstood what Ukraine is - and, far from extinguishing Ukraine as a nation, he's solidified it... He can't subjugate Ukraine. He can't win in that sense." 

 Mr Johnson said that he was "not optimistic" that Putin really wants peace. 

 "I think he's decided to double-down and to try to 'Groznyfy' the great cities of Ukraine in the way that he's always tried to do - and I think that's a tragic mistake," he said. 

 This was a  [reference to the Chechen city of Grozny](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60631433) , which Russia bombed heavily and besieged in 1999-2000.

## Title: Canada says it can help boost energy supplies

Canada has capacity to increase oil and gas exports by the equivalent of 300,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) by the end of this year, its natural resources minister has said. 

 Jonathan Wilkinson said Canada could increase oil exports by 200,000 bpd and gas by 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in order to help other countries reduce their reliance on Russian energy. 

 He said the country was also looking into ways to supply liquified natural gas (LNG), which it does not currently export. 

 "Our European friends and allies need Canada and others to step up," Wilkinson said. "They're telling us they need our help in getting off Russian oil and gas in the short term, while speeding up the energy transition across the continent," Wilkinson said. 

 To put this in perspective, Russia exports about five million barrels of crude oil each day, of which more than half goes to Europe.

## Title: Blinken to discuss Israel's role as conflict mediator

Looking ahead now, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will discuss Israel's role as mediator between Russia and Ukraine as part of his visit to the Middle East and North Africa which gets under way on Saturday. 

 Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been trying to negotiate an end to the conflict. 

 Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Yael Lempert made the announcement to reporters earlier. 

 She also warned that the war in Ukraine will only continue to increase the price of basic staples in the Middle East and North Africa region as wheat prices rise.

## Title: The unity of Europe as a whole really matters - Biden

It’s been a busy day for US President Joe Biden. He’s now at the European Council in Brussels attending a summit of EU leaders which is focusing on the war in Ukraine. 

 He repeated his claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying "to break up NATO", adding that Putin “would rather face 30 independent countries, than 30 united countries with the United States of America”. 

 Biden says the idea “of the unity of Europe as a whole - not just Nato, the G7 and this organisation [European Council], really matters. It’s the single most important thing that we can do to stop this guy who, in our country we believe, has already committed war crimes”.

## Title: Russia and Ukraine swap prisoners

Russia and Ukraine say they have conducted the first exchange of captured soldiers since the war began a month ago.  

 Ten Ukrainian soldiers were exchanged for 10 Russian soldiers, officials said.  

 In a separate exchange, 11 Russian civilian sailors who had been rescued from a ship that sank off Odesa were swapped for 19 Ukrainian seafarers from a ship captured by the Russians while they were trying to seize Snake Island in the Black Sea at the very start of the war.  

 The ship itself is being returned to Ukraine via a port in Turkey. 

 Earlier this week Russia and Ukraine said they had exchanged nine Russian prisoners for the mayor of Melitopol, a city in south-eastern Ukraine that has been captured by the Russian army.
