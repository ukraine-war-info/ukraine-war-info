## Title: Johnson again rules out Ukraine no-fly zone

Johnson says there is an "agony everyone feels in this group [Nato]" over its inability to do more to help "given the constraints we face". 

 The UK PM again rules out a no-fly zone over Ukraine - saying it would involve the RAF taking down Russian fast jets. No country in Nato is going to do that, he adds. 

 But Johnson says Nato is looking at providing missiles for Ukraine to defend itself from the air - and also from Grad rocket launchers - which he says have been merciless in their onslaught.

## Title: I'm not remotely anti-Russian - UK PM

Asked about a quote from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said earlier that Boris Johnson was the "most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, the UK PM insisted that he was "not remotely anti-Russian". 

 He said he was sympathetic to the Russian people - but not to their leader Vladimir Putin. 

 "We all agree that what Putin is doing is utterly catastrophic, his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric and the conduct of that invasion is moving into the type of behaviour that we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years," he says.

## Title: Talk of nuclear confrontation a distraction, says Johnson

Responding to a question from Bloomberg, Johnson says talk about the use of nuclear weapons is a distraction from what is going on in Ukraine. 

 He says the use of conventional weapons by Russia - including artillery - is "absolutely barbaric". 

 Moscow is trying to frame this as a confrontation between nuclear powers, he says - but it is between Russia and the people of Ukraine.

## Title: undefined

Johnson is asked about Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg saying earlier that there would be severe consequences if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine and does that mean boots on the ground? 

 The PM says those weapons are viewed with “utter horror” by Nato leaders.  

 He says if Putin were to engage in anything like that “the consequences would be very, very severe”. 

 You have to have a bit of ambiguity about your response, he adds - but it would be “catastrophic for him” and “I think he understands that”.

## Title: Putin was banking on Nato being split - Biden

Biden says the US is determined to sustain its efforts with its allies on Ukraine. 

 He said the US was announcing new sanctions on 400 Russian individuals and entities, including 300 members of the Duma - Russia's parliament - as well as oligarchs and companies that "fuel the Russian war machine". 

 And he says Putin badly miscalculated in his decision to invade Ukraine. 

 "Putin was banking on Nato being split. From my conversations with him it was clear he didn't think it could sustain this cohesion," he says 

 "Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he thought he was going to get when he went into Ukraine. 

 "Nato has never never
been more united than it is today."
