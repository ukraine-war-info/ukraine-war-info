## Title: Russian defence minister 'suffers heart attack'

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, has claimed that Russia's defence minister suffered a heart attack.  

 Sergei Shoigu had not been seen publicly since 11 March, until he appeared briefly in a video released by Putin on Thursday 24 March.  

 "Shoigu's heart attack happened after a tough accusation by Putin for a complete failure of the invasion of Ukraine," Gerashchenko wrote on Facebook, adding that he is currently "undergoing rehabilitation" in hospital.  

 There has been no confirmation from Russia of Shoigu's alleged health problems.

## Title: Putin signs law targeting 'fake news'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has formally approved a law which says people found guilty of spreading "fake news" about the work of officials abroad can be handed a 15-year jail sentence. 

 The law bears several similarities to one passed after the invasion began that calls for jail time for people who spread false information about Russia's armed forces.  

 The news about the latest law was reported by Interfax in Russia on Friday.  

 The Interfax report cites a senior lawmaker who argued the legislation was necessary to stop people from spreading falsehoods about Russian embassies and organisations abroad.

## Title: The danger of wishful Western thinking

We've come out of a dark period of ugly political division and tragic medical crisis and we are longing for something good to believe in.  

 Forty-four million brave Ukrainians seem to have risen to the challenge and given us cause for hope in the power of the underdog. 

 We root for them. We are amazed by their resilience. We long for them to survive and stay free. So it's understandable that we may fall victim to what one analyst eloquently described as Western wishful thinking. 

 After the invasion one US senator told me confidently that whatever happened, the Ukrainian people would be free. It was the optimism I've come to expect, and appreciate, from US politicians. And we hope it will be true. 

 History reminds us, however, that good doesn't always prevail. Not against Russia anyway. 

 Ask the Syrians, still stuck under the boot of the Assad regime, their cities destroyed by Russian bombs. Ask the Chechens, who saw their capital flattened on the orders of Vladimir Putin.  

 The Ukrainians' success depends on two things, their own phenomenal courage, and, just as critical, the steady supply of military hardware that it's getting from Western countries. 

 If those countries, or the public in those countries, start for a moment to think David has beaten Goliath then the flow of weapons could slow or stop. That would be catastrophic for the Ukrainian resistance.

## Title: Ukraine's air defence forces Russia to use more drones - UK

Russia is most likely growing increasingly reliant on its stockpile of unmanned drones, according to the latest UK intelligence update. 

 "Robust Ukrainian air defences has almost certainly limited manned flights beyond their front lines,"  [the Ministry of Defence says](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1507480978553552902) , adding that drones have probably replaced piloted sorties. 

 The UK has sanctioned a further 65 individuals with ties to the Russian invasion, including most recently Kronshtadt - a Russian defence company that produces the Orion drone and others. 

 US defence officials said on Friday that Russia had increased its aerial sorties in the past week, flying some 300 per day.

## Title: Ukrainian boxing champ leaving military for match

Heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has confirmed he is preparing for a rematch with Britain's Anthony Joshua. 

 Usyk is set to face Joshua in July after his victory last year saw him crowned unified heavyweight champion. 

 The 35-year-old left his native Ukraine, where he had been helping to defend the country from the Russian invasion, on Wednesday. 

 "I decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua," Usyk posted on Instagram on Friday. 

 Usyk enlisted in Ukraine's military in March following the Russian invasion. 

 A banner reading "Hands off Ukraine, Putin!" could be seen behind Usyk in his Instagram video. 

 "A large number of my friends support me, all the rest of the good and peace, thank God for everything," he wrote.

## Title: What will be Russia's next move?

It's probably too early to say whether Moscow has changed plans or reduced its ambitions in Ukraine - but there's definitely a shift in emphasis. 

 The end of what Russia has called the "first stage" of its attack likely means a more concerted effort to push beyond the "line of contact" that separates Ukrainian government-held territory in the east from the Russian-backed separatist "people's republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk. 

 The pace of Russia's advance in other areas of Ukraine remains glacial. It's probably way too early to conclude that Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv, but Western officials say that Russia continues to experience setback after setback. 

 A renewed push now could see Russian troops pushing out into so-far unconquered areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, possibly aiming to link up with forces moving south from Kharkiv and Izyum. 

 And if Russia can succeed in finally pacifying the port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, then other forces could move north and complete the encirclement of Ukraine's frontline Joint Forces Operation troops. 

 Some of these objectives still seem out of reach. Mariupol's defenders are putting up a ferocious fight, preventing Russia from fully achieving another of its pre-war ambitions - a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula to the Donbas. 

 But if Moscow has concluded that it makes more sense to concentrate, for the time being, on achieving one objective at a time, it's likely to concentrate its firepower, especially from the air. 

 If the coming days do see a shift of focus to the Donbas, that doesn't yet mean that Moscow has abandoned its wider ambitions. 

 "We don't see a re-evaluation of the invasion as a whole," a senior US defence official said.

Ukraine's President Zelensky says "powerful blows" to Russia have slowed its momentum, claiming that 16,000 Russian troops have been killed so far  

  .  The Russian defence ministry has  [given an update on its military casualties](https://t.me/rian_ru/155675) , for only the second time since it began its military assault, claiming that 1,351 of its soldiers have been killed and 3,825 wounded   .

## Title: WATCH: Fact-checking Putin's false 'Nazi' claims

One of President Putin’s justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to "denazify" the country. 

 The BBC's Ros Atkins looks at the distortions and untruths that Russia is spreading about Nazis in Ukraine - including on the role of the Azov regiment, who are based in Mariupol and are part of Ukraine's national guard.

## Title: Biden's Saturday speech in Poland to 'speak to stakes of the moment'

The White House is billing President Biden’s upcoming speech on Saturday evening as a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment”. 

 He is expected to outline what the war in Ukraine means for the world and where he sees the conflict going from here - explaining why he thinks it is so important that the west remains united in the face of Russian aggression. 

 Private talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda will include discussion of his offer to hand over nearly 30 soviet-era MIG fighter jets to Ukraine.  

 These are planes that President Zelensky says he desperately needs. But American is blocking the plan to transfer them via a US airbase, saying it could provoke an escalation from Russia and drag Nato into the conflict. 

 President Biden will also meet some of the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland in the last few weeks. 

 The US is promising one billion dollars in humanitarian aid to help with the escalating refugee crisis that Poland is facing.

## Title: Russian forces not preparing to storm Kyiv - US official in Warsaw

A high-ranking American official has said Russian troops are not preparing to storm the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.  

 The official spoke to a group of reporters including from the BBC in Warsaw, on condition of anonymity.  

 A few more details from his speech: 

  .  Russia has carried out 1,250 rocket launches since it began its invasion of Ukraine   .  Russian military aircraft have begun to fly more frequently, making up to 300 sorties a day   .  The fighting for the village of Makarov near Kyiv continues;   .  Russian troops did not advance in the attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city;   .  Russian troops stopped 15km from Mykolaiv in an attempt to cut the southern city off from Ukrainian support;   .  The Russian military was able to break through the defenses of Izyum and advance to the south of the Donbas in south-eastern Ukraine.  

 Earlier, a Pentagon source reported that the Ukrainian military could regain control of Kherson.  

 Russia claimed control over the southern Ukrainian city in early March.

## Title: Will Russia's invasion of Ukraine push Japan to go nuclear?

How could Japan ever contemplate getting nukes? It's a ridiculous idea. Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered a nuclear attack. Twice. 

 Or so the story has gone for the last 77 years. 

 But Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving post-war prime minister. Mr Abe has begun saying loudly and publicly that Japan should, indeed, think seriously and urgently about nuclear weapons. 

 It's no coincidence this call-to-arms has come just as Russia has invaded Ukraine 

 What we are talking about here is a fundamental break with Japan's post-war commitment to pacifism - something enshrined in its post-war constitution. 

 But Mr Abe is an astute politician. He knows Ukraine has come as a huge shock, and he knows the Japanese public is worried about an unpredictable nuclear-armed North Korea and an increasingly aggressive China. 

 It all still feels very far-fetched. Japanese law has explicitly banned any nuclear weapons from its soil since 1971. But Mr Abe is not alone in calling for that ban to now be debated.

## Title: Missiles from Germany arrive in Ukraine: reports

A shipment of 1,500 Strela anti-aircraft missiles and 100 MG3 machine guns have arrived in Ukraine from Germany, the German Press Agency cited Ukrainian government officials as saying.  

 German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Wednesday that further supplies of the Strela missiles were Ukraine-bound following delays in deliveries. 

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine has seen Germany reverse its historical policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones.  

 "We are one of the biggest weapons suppliers in this situation, it doesn't make us proud but it's what we must do to help Ukraine," Reuters quoted Ms Baerbock as saying. 

 The Strela missiles had been in the inventories of the former Communist East German army.

## Title: WATCH: Russian forces appear to shoot at fleeing civilians

Warning: Some images may be distressing to viewers. 

 *There is a video, but the bot cannot display it. Please click on the link above to view it.*

 Aerial footage captured by a reconnaissance drone shows what appears to be Russian forces firing on a column of cars carrying civilians as they attempted to flee an area near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.  

 Images, shot by a territorial defence group, showed the cars turning in the opposite direction to escape the gunfire.  

 "We heard shooting, [the Russian soldiers] started shooting at the column," a man in one of the cars told the BBC.  

 "I saw my father-in-law turning back. I also started turning back. We all turned back. Later we all stopped and saw one car was missing," he said.  

 One man and one woman were killed in the incident.

## Title: We are continuing to repel attacks on Kyiv - Ukraine military forces

In its daily morning update, Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces says that its troops are  [continuing to repel attacks by Russian forces on the capital city Kyiv](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/280871150892637) . 

 The Ukraine military said Russian forces have experienced difficulty replenishing quality personnel and shoring up losses suffered during the invasion, partly due to the impact of international sanctions.  

 It also claimed Russian equipment was in "poor technical condition" due to "negligent prior exploitation and prolonged storage". 

 These factors were affecting Russia's ability to "maintain the necessary pace of combat and achieve the war's ultimate goal", the statement said. 

 However this has not stopped Russia from continuing to lob assaults and air raids and inflict damage on Ukrainian forces, the update added.  

 It claims Moscow has deployed maximum units in the partly-Russian held territory of  **Crimea** , alongside in areas of  **Kherson** ,  **Zaporizhzhia** ,  **Mariupol** and  **Donetsk** regions, in order to "suppress the resistance of the residents". 

 In the  **Donetsk** and
 **Luhansk** regions, Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks and destroyed 8 tanks and 11 units of the enemy's vehicle
equipment.  

 The update claimed Ukrainian air defense units shot
down 3 planes and 3 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) belonging to Russia.  

 The BBC has not been able to verify this information.

## Title: WHO says attacks on hospitals are increasing daily

There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances, and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a "daily basis", says the World Health Organization (WHO). 

 It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare. 

 Since 24 February, the WHO has reviewed [ and verified 72 separate ](https://extranet.who.int/ssa/Index.aspx) attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine causing at least 71 deaths and 37 injuries. 

 Most have damaged hospitals, medical transports and supply stores, but the WHO has also recorded the "probable" abduction or detention of healthcare staff and patients. 

 "We are concerned that this number is increasing daily," the WHO's Ukraine country representative Jarno Habicht told the BBC. 

 "Health facilities should be safe places for both doctors and nurses, but also patients to turn to for treatment. This should not happen."

## Title: Russia sets its sights on gaining control of the Donbas

**Moscow has announced that the main objectives of what it calls "its special military operation” in Ukraine have been accomplished. It says it's now going to focus on gaining control of the southeastern region of Donbas. Our chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, is in Kyiv. She reports on the response to Moscow's announcement in the Ukrainian capital:** 

 It’s always been known that the primary objective, as we heard from Moscow, today, is the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, and the land corridor connecting the Donbas to the Crimean peninsula, both areas that Russian forces went into, in 2014.  

 The Donbas contains two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, that touch the Russian border and since 2014 have been controlled by Russian-backed rebels. 

 Some of the best Ukrainian fighting units are there, and the concern has been that Russia would try to cut them off either from resupplying them or allowing them to move to other fronts.” 

 Moscow today, said that this wasn’t their primary objective, but they didn’t rule it out. 

 And so while we see Russian forces consolidating their positions on the outskirts of Kyiv, digging in their artillery, it’s the Ukrainians who are going on the offensive, pushing them back in the east and attacking them in the north-west. 

 This is not a country that will be at rest as this invasion goes on.

## Title: Kharkiv emergency services struggle to clear damage

An update from Ukraine's State Emergency Services (SES) in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city: 

 A statement from the SES notes that its personnel have made a total of 59 trips between 25 and 26 March, in attempts to clear rubble and wreckage from buildings destroyed in Russian strikes, as well as to put out fires. 

 It said shelling had destroyed or damaged a number of residential high-rise apartments, warehouses and other private buildings in a number of districts. 

 Personnel are also working to disarm unexploded bombs and artillery, the statement added. 

 The eastern city is only about 50km from the Russian border and has come under constant attack - many civilians have been killed and injured since the invasion began.

## Title: Russia to conduct drills on disputed islands after Japan-imposed sanctions

Russia has said it is conducting drills on islands that are contested by Japan, days after withdrawing from peace talks in response to Toky's decision to impose sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.  

 Four islands - which Russia calls the Southern Kurils and Japan calls the Northern Territories - are the subject of a more than 70-year-old dispute between the two nations. 

 Because of the dispute, Russia and Japan have not yet signed a peace treaty to end World War II. 

 Earlier this week, Russia said it was withdrawing from negotiations with Japan aimed at signing that treaty, because of Tokyo's tough stance against Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 

 And now, Russia's Eastern Military District says it will conduct military drills on the islands with more than 3,000 troops and hundreds of pieces of army equipment. 

 Japan had earlier condemned Russia for withdrawing from the peace talks and for halting joint economic projects in relation to the islands.

## Title: Russia continues to use heavy fire power in urban areas: UK MoD

In its latest update, the UK ministry of defence says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties. 

 Forces seemed to be proving reluctant to engage in large-scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralise defending forces, the update said.  

 The statement added that Russian forces continue to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including  **Kharkiv** ,  **Chernihiv**  and  **Mariupol** .

## Title: British ex-soldier on front line at Irpin

Shane Matthews, a former British soldier who travelled here from the UK with a Ukrainian friend, was part of Commander Oleg's unit in Irpin - just to the north-west of Kyiv.  

 A medic and sniper, Shane said he had seen many dead civilians there, including a family of four whose car was hit by an artillery shell. So little was left of them, he said, that their remains would barely have filled a bin bag. 

 Unlike every Ukrainian from the president down, Shane did not believe Nato should intervene in Ukraine because of the risks of a wider war.

## Title: Numbers crossing to Poland starting to fall

The number of people fleeing Ukraine for Poland has started to fall in recent days, with 30,500 crossing on Friday, down 6.4% from the previous day, the Polish Border Guard said on Saturday.  

 By 0600GMT on Saturday, 6,100 people had crossed - that’s down 11% from the same period on Friday. 

 More than 2.2 million people have crossed in to Poland since the war began, the agency wrote on Twitter. 

 Some of those people fleeing Ukraine have already left Poland, but Warsaw University migration expert Prof Maciej Duszczyk estimates around 1.2-1.3 million refugees remain. 

 More than 300,000 people have entered Ukraine via Poland since the war began, the agency said.

## Title: Russian invasion strategy 'has failed'

Russia's initial strategy in Ukraine has failed and its army now has to decide what to do next, a top military analyst has told the BBC. 

 Phillips O'Brien, who is professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, said many foreign observers had taken the "easy intellectual way out" of assuming that Russian military superiority would prevail in the war. 

 However, this was "a very false opinion" of Russia's capabilities that did not take into account whether its soldiers were willing to take risks, he said. 

 At the same time, Ukraine's capabilities had been underestimated, he added. 

 Ukrainians had been preparing for war since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and did not want to live "under a Russian dictatorship", Prof O'Brien said. 

 "Now  [Russia has to decide what to do](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60882156) : they can either escalate up or they can escalate down," he added. 

 Escalating down would be the most rational course of action and would involve trying to reach a deal, but "they don't seem to be willing to do that now", he said. 

 Escalating up would mean either rebuilding the army from scratch or "opening up a can of worms" by resorting to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. 

 "Either they escalate down or escalate up, but what they have now can't do the job," he concluded.

## Title: Biden to meet Ukraine ministers in Poland

US President Joe Biden is set to meet two Ukrainian ministers later in Poland - his first face-to-face meeting with such high-level officials since Russian forces invaded the country a month ago. 

 The White House says he will "drop by" a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin with their Ukrainian counterparts, Dmytro Kuleba and Oleksii Reznikov. 

 Biden has been in Poland since Friday and is set to deliver a major speech about the conflict later on Saturday. 

 Some say the fact that the Ukrainian ministers are leaving their country is a sign of their growing confidence in how the war with Russia is going.

 There's been intense speculation that he is having health problems, or has had a heart attack. 

 There was nothing to indicate when the footage was filmed.

## Title: Russians seize town for Chernobyl workers - governor

Russian forces have taken control of Slavutych, the town housing workers for the defunct nuclear power plant of Chernobyl, according to the regional governor, Oleksandr Pavlyuk. 

 He posted a message on the Telegram messaging app saying Russian soldiers had seized the town's hospital and kidnapped the mayor. 

 Slavutych was built for the evacuated personnel of the Chernobyl plant after the 1986 disaster - the world's worst ever nuclear accident. 

 On Friday, the UN's nuclear watchdog warned that fighting in the town was stopping workers from travelling to and from the plant, which still houses several nuclear waste containment facilities. 

 Russian forces seized Chernobyl itself right at the start of the conflict.

## Title: Putin thought he could divide Nato, says Biden

US President Joe Biden says he thinks Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been surprised to find he hasn't been able divide Nato allies in their reaction to his invasion of Ukraine. 

 [Biden has been speaking during a trip to the Polish capital Warsaw](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60854242) , which has seen him meet Ukrainian government ministers, as well as Poland's President Andrzej Duda. 

 "I'm confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to divide Nato, being able to separate the eastern flank from the west, being able to separate nations based on past histories," Biden said. 

 "But he hasn't been able to do it - we've all stayed together. 

 "I just think it's so important that we, Poland and the United States, keep in lock step how we're proceeding." 

 He also says history has shown the importance of the US not remaining on the sidelines during conflict in Europe. 

 "We have learned from sad experience in two world wars, when we've stayed out and not been involved in stability in Europe, it always comes back to haunt us in the United States.  

 "So I've been saying for a long time, as senator who visited here and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, as vice president and now as president, that stability in Europe is critically important to the United States in terms of our interest - not only in Europe but around the world."

## Title: Russian forces enter town near Chernobyl

More now from Slavutych, the city where workers of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant live.  

 Earlier it was reported that Russian forces had taken control of the city and that the mayor had been taken hostage.  

 Their actions brought thousands of angry protesters onto the streets, waving Ukrainian flags and chanting patriotic slogans.  

 A Slavutych resident who took part in the protest told the BBC that the "invaders" had now moved back to the entrance of the city, and the Ukrainian flag still flies above the local administration building. 

 The resident said the city's mayor spoke at the rally after the reports of his kidnapping, suggesting he had been released again.  

 Slavutych was built after the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, when a  reactor exploded releasing radioactive material into the environment.  

 The site of the power plant itself has been under the control of Russian forces since the first day of the war. 

 Around 300 workers were trapped there after it was seized, although some have now been able to leave.

## Title: UK must do more to help refugees, London mayor says

The UK should be doing "much more" to help Ukrainian refugees, the mayor of London has said at a march in support of the country. 

 A large crowd has gathered near central London's Hyde Park this afternoon for a march and vigil to send a unified message of support to the people of Ukraine. 

 "Londoners over the last few weeks have shown that we're opening our arms to Ukrainian refugees, whether it's by donating money to those charities doing a brilliant job in Ukraine or by opening our homes to those fleeing Ukraine," Khan says.  

 He says it's important over the next few weeks to make it much " [easier for those who are fleeing Ukraine to come here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60840808) ", suggesting other European nations have performed better. 

 Protesters draped in the Ukrainian colours of yellow and blue have been making their way towards Trafalgar Square. 

 Chants of "we stand with Ukraine" ring out as traffic is brought to a standstill.

## Title: Biden promises more military help - Ukraine

The US has promised to increase its military aid to Ukraine, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says after meeting Joe Biden in Poland. 

 "No other country provided Ukraine with more support than the United States. And this is crucial," he says. 

 "Ukrainian stamina and Western weapons - mostly American weapons - is the recipe for success on the battleground." 

 He has not provided any details about the extra military assistance but says: "Today we did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defence co-operation will evolve."

## Title: Putin is a butcher, says Biden

US President Joe Biden has described Vladimir Putin as a butcher, during a meeting with Ukrainian refugees in Poland.  

 Biden made the comment at a televised event at the national stadium in Warsaw, on a visit to show support for Poland over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, during which he also met members of the Ukrainian government. 

 A reporter asked the president "You're dealing every day with Vladimir Putin, look at what he's done to these people. What does it make you think?" 

 "He's a butcher," responded Biden before walking away. 

 Biden also said each refugee he spoke to had asked him to say a prayer for the safety of their father or brother back home in Ukraine. 

 In response to the president's comments, a Kremlin spokesman quoted by Russia's TASS news agency said Biden's comment narrows the prospects of mending ties between Washington and Moscow.

## Title: Lviv blasts: 'It was really scary'

More now on the explosions in Lviv. We've heard from residents there. Volodymyr Kachinsky, 24, was working at a restaurant near the area of the western city hit by rocket strikes on Saturday afternoon. 

 “I had never heard anything like this. I can only imagine what’s happening in the east.” 

 He says he still thought Lviv was safe. “[But] it was really scary.” 

 Maryanna Pack, a 39-year-old economist, was also nearby. 

 “It was a loud noise,” she said. “We’re feeling unprotected. Nobody really cares about what’s happening here. We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely destroyed. It’s really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the country too.” 

 She said she felt the war coming closer to this city.  

 “Things have changed dramatically. We spend a lot of time in shelters,” she said, because of the constant air-raid sirens. “This is creating fear and anger.”

## Title: 'We stand with you' Biden tells Ukraine, citing historic uprisings

"My message to the people of Ukraine... we stand with you, period," President Biden says during his speech in Warsaw, a line greeted by cheers. 

 "Today's fighting in Kyiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battles in a long struggle," he says. 

 "Hungary in 1956, Poland in 1956 and then again in 1981, Czechoslovakia in 1968 - Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings but the resistance continued until finally in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all the walls of Soviet domination, they fell and the people prevailed. 

 "The battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War. 

 "Over the last 30 years the forces of autocracy have revived all over the world, It's hallmarks are familiar ones. Contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself. 

 "Today, Russia has strangled democracy and has sought to do elsewhere." 

 Biden says it is obscene that Vladimir Putin has lied by saying he is trying to de-Nazify Ukraine.

## Title: 'You the Russian people are not our enemy,' Biden says

Next, Joe Biden addresses the Russian people, saying he's worked with Russian leaders for decades, since the height of the Cold War. 

 "I've always spoken directly and honestly to you the Russian people," he says. 

 "Let me say this, if you're able to listen. You the Russian people are not our enemy.  

 "I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents. 

 "Or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards for God's sake, being pummelled with Russian missiles and bombs. 

 "Or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee, supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission. 

 "Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine's children. 

 "These are not the actions of a great nation." 

 He closes his speech with a reference to Vladimir Putin - "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."

## Title: No food for children in Mariupol, deputy mayor says

The deputy mayor of the [ besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60825226)  says people are starting to die from starvation and dehydration, as food and
water supplies run low and no humanitarian aid is allowed in. 

 “Some are dying from dehydration and lack of food.
Some are dying from lack of medicine, insulin... Because people cannot find
medical help,” Sergey Orlov tells the BBC. 

 “Some mothers do not have milk, and they don't have food
for children. What should they do with their infants? I don’t know. There’s no
food for children at all in the city.” 

 Mariupol has been under relentless Russian attacks since the
early days of the war, and pictures show a city in ruins, with entire
neighbourhoods destroyed. Orlov says 70% of hospitals in the city have been “destroyed
by bombing and shelling”. 

 Communication with the city is difficult, as the phone
network is intermittent, so it is hard to independently verify information.
Residents spend most of their time in shelters or basements with no
electricity, running water, or gas. 

 “People are just looking for any possibility to survive.
[They] share food, water, they’re collecting wood to cook in the street,” Orlov
says. 

 More than 100,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol. Efforts
to carry out large-scale evacuations have failed, although thousands have
managed to leave in recent days in private vehicles.

## Title: About 4,500 residential buildings destroyed, Ukrainian minister says

Russia has destroyed about 4,500 residential buildings, 100 enterprises, 400 educational institutions and 150 medical establishments in Ukraine, a Ukrainian government minister says. 

 The total damage across the country will be assessed after the end of hostilities and removal of mines, Minister for Community and Territorial Development Oleksiy Chernyshov says, as quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.  

 According to preliminary assessments, the losses incurred by Ukraine have reached tens of billions of US dollars, with the sum increasing daily. 

 With a view to reconstruction efforts, the government has simplified procedures for construction material imports.
   However, the minister adds, any reconstruction must be preceded by clearing mines and rubble.  

 Ukraine hopes to involve domestic and foreign specialists in reconstruction efforts.

## Title: Not for Biden to decide if Putin leads Russia - Kremlin

It is not for Joe Biden to decide if Vladimir Putin stays in power, the Kremlin says. 

 As we reported earlier, the US president gave a speech with comments aimed directly at the Russian people, closing with: "For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power." 

 According to Reuters, a Kremlin spokesman responded: "That's not for Biden to decide. The president of Russia is elected by Russians." 

 A White House official says Biden was not calling for regime change, but making the point Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbours or the region. 

 Biden was delivering the speech earlier in Warsaw, where he has met Ukrainian government ministers and refugees who have crossed the border into Poland.

## Title: Keep together with Ukraine, Kyiv mayor urges Londoners

The mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv - former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko - has urged thousands of protesters in central London to stand with Ukraine. 

 A huge crowd of people, including Ukrainians living in the UK, politicians and celebrities,  [marched through London in solidarity with Ukraine](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60887157) . 

 Klitschko, speaking via video link from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square: "We defend, right now, the same principles.  

 "Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine." 

 London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced more than £1.1m in funding to support migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK capital, and said he was "full of admiration" for people who have offered Ukrainian refugees somewhere to stay. 

 Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, told the crowd: "I urge you to keep up the good work, the military and humanitarian aid.  

 "The sanctions must continue until the Russian economy has stopped in its tracks."

## Title: Kharkiv music festival goes ahead - underground

The Kharkiv Music Festival, in Ukraine's second city, has gone ahead, despite relentless shelling by Russia since the start of the war. 

 Organisers insisted the event must start as scheduled, so musicians have been performing deep underground, on the marble steps of a metro station which serves as a huge bomb shelter.  

 A small crowd watched, some with their eyes closed, others holding children or pets, as a string quintet played classical music, as well as the national anthem. 

 A cello player who performed at the festival, Denys Karachevtsev, said he wanted to deliver a message of hope to the people of Kharkiv:  

 "My message is that we have no fear, we are strong, and we can be helpful for our country, each person [in their own way]." 

 Violinist Tatiana Choukh said "it was maybe the best concert of my life".

## Title: Russian air strikes were a message for Biden, Lviv mayor says

The Russian air strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv today were intended to send a message to US President Joe Biden, mayor Andriy Sadovyy says.  

 He 's been speaking at a joint briefing with the head of the Lviv military civil administration, Maksym Kozytskyy, broadcast on YouTube. 

 "I think that, with today's strikes, the aggressor is sending greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland now. Lviv is 70 km away from Poland," Sadovyy says.  

 "I think the whole world should realise that the threat is extremely serious." 

 Kozytskyy says the missiles hit two critical infrastructure facilities, one of which was an oil depot in a residential area in Lviv, and another was a military plant also located in a residential area. Each of them was targeted by two missile attacks, he says.  

  No-one was killed, Kozytskyy adds, but five people sought medical help.

## Title: Kharkiv nuclear research reactor hit - reports

A nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been hit by Russian shelling, according to authorities cited in a Ukrainian news outlet. 

 The Kyiv Independent said because of constant shelling in the area, in the north east of the country, authorities have been unable to assess the damage to the site. 

 Russia has been repeatedly criticised for targeting nuclear power plants in Ukraine, such as the Zhaporizhia nuclear plant in the south east. 

 Though risky, there has so far been no release of radioactive material from this site.

## Title: Could Lviv's time as a relatively safe haven be ending?

First, mid-afternoon, the air raid sirens went off. Then,
three powerful explosions, and thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the
distance. Hours later, another attack. 

 It all happened a day after Russia said it was focusing its
invasion of Ukraine on the east. Lviv is in the extreme opposite. 

 And this distance from the worst of Russia’s aggression,
where people have been under unrelenting bombing and shelling, turned this city
into something like a safe haven. Displaced people, humanitarian workers,
volunteers. They are all here. 

 That perception could be changing. Maryanna Pack, a
39-year-old economist who was near the site of the blast, gives a passionate
testimony that may be shared by many. “We’re feeling unprotected. Nobody really
cares about what’s happening here,” she says. 

 “We need more help now. Eastern Ukraine has been completely
destroyed. It’s really possible that could happen to Lviv and the west of the
country too.”

Russia's oligarchs can continue to do business in Turkey so long as they respect international law, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says.

 "Of course, if it is legal; if it is not against international law, I will consider it," he says. 

 "If it is against international law, that's another story."

## Title: Concern for Chernobyl power plant's workers - IAEA

Earlier we reported that the city of Slavutych, where many of the Chernobyl power plant's workers live, has been taken by Russian forces. 

 Now the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has expressed its concern over the welfare of the plant's employees, as there has been no staff rotation at the plant for nearly a week. 

 The IAEA's director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, says there are concerns about the ability of staff to regularly rotate and return to their homes to rest. 

 Earlier this month, Grossi stressed the ability of staff to carry out their tasks without undue pressure is one of "the seven indispensable pillars for nuclear safety". 

 This is not the only nuclear plant held by the Russians. Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, is also in the hands of Russian troops.

 The western Ukrainian city of Lviv  [has come under heavy rocket fire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60887974)  and James Elder, who's from the UN children's charity Unicef, says the attacks add to the terror felt by people there.  

 "I'd been to a hospital where I see women go down, every time there's an air raid siren, carrying two day old babies or women 36 weeks pregnant who are frigid cold", he says.  

 "Those women are hiding again tonight - terrified, petrified. And so many other people and children." 

 "You can just see in the faces of families who have been through this in Kyiv, or Khakiv, and thought they were getting a moment's respite. Well the missiles tell a very different story tonight."

## Title: Zelensky says Ukraine needs just a fraction of Nato military hardware

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demanded the West steps up military supplies, saying it wasn't just Ukraine at risk. 

 "What is the price of this security? This is very specific. These are planes for Ukraine. These are tanks for our state. This is anti-missile defense. This is anti-ship weaponry. This is what our partners have. This is what is covered with dust at their storage facilities," he said.  

 "Because it cannot be acceptable for everyone on the continent if the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia and the whole of Eastern Europe are at risk of a clash with the Russian invaders."" 

 He said Ukraine needed just 1% of Nato's tanks and aircraft.  

 "We did not ask for more. And we do not ask for more. And we have already been waiting for 31 days!"
